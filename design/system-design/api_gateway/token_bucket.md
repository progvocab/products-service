Perfect 👍 — let’s simplify the **Token Bucket Algorithm** used in Spring Cloud Gateway (and many rate limiters).

We’ll go step-by-step in **plain English** first, then visualize it with a **Mermaid flowchart** 👇

## 🪣 **Simple Explanation — Token Bucket in 5 Steps**

Imagine every user has a **bucket full of tokens**.
Each **request takes 1 token**.
Tokens are **refilled over time**.

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Logic

1. **Start** – Each user has a bucket with a max capacity (e.g., 10 tokens).
2. **Refill tokens** – Tokens are added at a steady rate (e.g., 1 per second).
3. **Receive request** – Each new request *asks for* one token.
4. **Check bucket:**

   * ✅ If enough tokens → allow request and subtract 1 token.
   * ❌ If no tokens → deny request (rate limit hit).
5. **Repeat** – Over time, tokens are added again so the user can send more requests later.

## 💡 Example

| Time (seconds) | Tokens in bucket | Request arrives? | Allowed? | Remaining tokens       |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 0              | 10               | Yes              | ✅        | 9                      |
| 1              | 9                | Yes              | ✅        | 8                      |
| 2              | 8                | No               | —        | +1 token added (now 9) |
| 3              | 9                | Yes              | ✅        | 8                      |
| 10             | Refilled to 10   | —                | —        | 10                     |

## 🧠 Quick Summary Table

| Concept            | Meaning                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Bucket**         | Container for tokens per user/client       |
| **Token**          | Unit of permission to make a request       |
| **Replenish rate** | Tokens added per second                    |
| **Burst capacity** | Maximum tokens bucket can hold             |
| **Request**        | Consumes one or more tokens                |
| **Empty bucket**   | Client must wait until tokens are refilled |

Would you like me to also show the **timeline view** (tokens over time vs requests) in a simple Mermaid sequence-style chart next?
That helps visualize *why bursts are allowed but average rate stays limited*.
