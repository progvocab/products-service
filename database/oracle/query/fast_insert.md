Excellent â€” that rules out the most common cause âœ…

So if you **didnâ€™t commit after every insert** and it still takes ~1 hour for just 1000 records in **Oracle**, then something deeper is going wrong.
Letâ€™s go step by step and isolate the bottleneck ðŸ‘‡

---

## ðŸ§© Step-by-Step Diagnosis

### 1. **How are you executing the insert?**

When using **Oracle SQL Developer**, even if you wrap everything in one transaction, it still:

* Parses each statement individually
* Sends it over JDBC
* Waits for a response before the next statement

So effectively, youâ€™re still doing **1000 network round-trips** to the database â€” even though theyâ€™re in one transaction.
Thatâ€™s why SQL Developer feels slow for large batches.

ðŸ‘‰ **Test this:**
Run the same insert script using `sqlplus` (command-line client) or a simple PL/SQL block â€” youâ€™ll likely see it finish in **under 2 seconds**.

---

### 2. **Are there triggers, indexes, or constraints on the table?**

Every insert must:

* Check each **foreign key**
* Update all **indexes**
* Fire any **before/after triggers**

Each of these adds significant overhead.

âœ… **Try disabling temporarily for testing:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table DISABLE ALL TRIGGERS;
ALTER INDEX your_index_name UNUSABLE;
-- Do insert
ALTER INDEX your_index_name REBUILD;
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ALL TRIGGERS;
```

---

### 3. **Redo/Undo logging overhead**

Oracle writes to **redo logs** for every DML operation to maintain durability (ACID).
If your redo logs are on slow storage or too small, inserts become very slow.

âœ… **Optimize bulk loads:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table NOLOGGING;
```

Then re-enable after load:

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table LOGGING;
```

This avoids full redo logging during bulk inserts (but youâ€™ll lose recoverability for that operation if a crash happens).

---

### 4. **Network latency or GUI overhead**

SQL Developer uses JDBC and the GUI adds significant latency.
Even locally, every statement requires a **JDBC prepare â†’ execute â†’ fetch â†’ commit**.

âœ… **Fix:**
Use `sqlplus` or a script instead of SQL Developer:

```bash
sqlplus user/pass@db @insert_script.sql
```

This can reduce 1 hour â†’ <10 seconds.

---

### 5. **Try Bulk Insert (PL/SQL `FORALL`)**

Instead of executing 1000 individual `INSERT` statements, bind data and do them in one shot:

```sql
DECLARE
  TYPE emp_tab IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
  l_data emp_tab := emp_tab();
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..1000 LOOP
    l_data.EXTEND;
    l_data(l_data.LAST).emp_id := i;
    l_data(l_data.LAST).name := 'Emp_' || i;
    l_data(l_data.LAST).salary := 5000;
  END LOOP;

  FORALL i IN l_data.FIRST .. l_data.LAST
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES l_data(i);

  COMMIT;
END;
/
```

âœ… This uses *bulk binding* â†’ Oracle performs one context switch and one parse for all 1000 inserts.

---

### 6. **Measure Execution**

You can turn on SQL trace in SQL Developer to see whatâ€™s happening:

```sql
ALTER SESSION SET sql_trace = TRUE;
-- run your inserts
ALTER SESSION SET sql_trace = FALSE;
```

Then use `tkprof` to analyze where the time is being spent.

## ðŸ§  Summary: Why 1000 Inserts Take 1 Hour

| Cause                     | Description                               | Fix                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| SQL Developer GUI latency | JDBC executes each insert individually    | Use `sqlplus` or PL/SQL block    |
| Indexes/Triggers          | Each row updates many internal structures | Disable temporarily              |
| Redo logging              | Each insert writes redo data              | Use `NOLOGGING` during bulk load |
| Parsing overhead          | Each insert parsed separately             | Use `FORALL`                     |
| Network latency           | 1000 DB round-trips                       | Run locally or use batch API     |

If you tell me:

* The **table structure** (`DESC your_table;`)
* Whether it has **indexes / triggers**
* And whether your 1000 inserts are **handwritten SQL** or **generated via export/import**

â€¦I can show you the *exact optimized approach* to load that data in **a few seconds**.

Would you like me to help you build that optimized script next?
