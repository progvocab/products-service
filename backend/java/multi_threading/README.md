| Concept                            | Explanation                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thread**                         | A lightweight unit of execution. In Java, created by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`.           |
| **Thread Lifecycle**               | States: `New → Runnable → Running → Waiting/Blocked → Terminated`. Managed by JVM and OS.                     |
| **Thread Priorities**              | Each thread has a priority (`1` to `10`). JVM/OS uses it for scheduling (but not guaranteed).                 |
| **Runnable Interface**             | Defines the `run()` method. Preferred way to create threads (decouples task from thread).                     |
| **Callable & Future**              | `Callable<V>` returns a result and can throw exceptions. `Future` represents the result of async computation. |
| **Executor Framework**             | Provides a high-level API (`ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`) for managing thread pools.                |
| **Synchronization**                | Mechanism to control access to shared resources. Done with `synchronized` keyword or locks.                   |
| **Lock Interface (ReentrantLock)** | Provides explicit locking/unlocking, more flexible than `synchronized`.                                       |
| **Volatile Keyword**               | Ensures visibility of variable updates across threads. Prevents caching in thread-local memory.               |
| **Atomic Variables**               | (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, etc.) provide lock-free thread-safe operations.                               |
| **ThreadLocal**                    | Each thread has its own isolated copy of a variable. Useful for user sessions, request context.               |
| **Wait, Notify, NotifyAll**        | Methods used for inter-thread communication on objects’ monitors.                                             |
| **Deadlock**                       | Situation where two or more threads wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.                             |
| **Livelock**                       | Threads keep changing state in response to each other but never make progress.                                |
| **Starvation**                     | A thread never gets CPU time/resources due to low priority or scheduling.                                     |
| **Thread Pools**                   | Reuse fixed number of threads to improve performance (`Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`).                      |
| **Fork/Join Framework**            | Splits tasks into smaller subtasks (divide & conquer) and merges results (`ForkJoinPool`).                    |
| **Parallel Streams**               | High-level API for parallel data processing using the Fork/Join framework internally.                         |
| **CompletableFuture**              | Asynchronous, non-blocking computations with chaining (`thenApply`, `thenCombine`).                           |
| **Concurrency Utilities**          | Classes in `java.util.concurrent`: `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`, `BlockingQueue`.           |




* **Thread Safety**: Avoid race conditions using synchronization, locks, atomics.
* **Executors**: Prefer over manual `Thread` creation for better scalability.
* **Avoid Deadlocks**: Use consistent lock ordering, timeouts, or try-lock.
* **Best Practice**: Use high-level concurrency utilities (Executor, CompletableFuture) instead of low-level `wait/notify`.




## **Locking mechanism**: 🔒 
 

1. **Object Monitor (Intrinsic Lock)**

   * Obtained via `synchronized` methods or blocks.
   * Every object has a built-in monitor lock.
   

     ```java
     synchronized (obj) { ... }
     ```

2. **ReentrantLock (java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock)**

   * More flexible than `synchronized`.
   * Allows **tryLock()**, **lockInterruptibly()**, and **fair locking**.
   * Fair Lock allows the longest waiting Thread to acquire Lock
   * An unfair lock allows a thread to potentially acquire the lock even if other threads have been waiting longer, if the lock becomes available at the exact moment the thread attempts to acquire it. This can lead to higher throughput in some scenarios but risks thread starvation.

     ```java
     Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); //unfair
     lock.lock();
     try { ... } finally { lock.unlock(); }

     Lock fair = new ReentrantLock(true); //fair lock
     ```

3. **ReentrantReadWriteLock**

   * Provides **read lock** (shared, multiple readers allowed) and **write lock** (exclusive).
   * Good for scenarios with more reads than writes.

4. **StampedLock (Java 8+)**

   * Optimized for read-mostly use cases.
   * Supports **optimistic reads** (no blocking).
   * More scalable than `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.

5. **Semaphore (java.util.concurrent)**

   * Controls access to a resource pool with a set number of permits.
   * Example: limit to N concurrent threads.

6. **CountDownLatch**

   * Not a lock in the strict sense, but **blocks threads until a count reaches zero**.
   * Often used for **one-time synchronization**.

7. **CyclicBarrier**

   * Synchronizes a set of threads at a barrier point before continuing execution.
   * Useful for **multi-threaded algorithms**.

8. **Phaser (Java 7+)**

   * More flexible version of `CyclicBarrier` for **multi-phase synchronization**.

9. **Atomic Variables (java.util.concurrent.atomic)**

   * Lock-free thread-safe operations (CAS — Compare-And-Swap).
   * Example: `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`.

10. **Volatile Keyword**

* Not a lock, but ensures **visibility** of changes across threads.
* Used to prevent caching issues in multi-threading.

---

 **Summary**:

* **Basic locking** → `synchronized` (object monitors).
* **Advanced locking** → `ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`, `StampedLock`.
* **Coordination tools** → `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Phaser`.
* **Lock-free** → `Atomic` classes + `volatile`.

##  Default Threads 🧵 in a fresh JVM 

Threads at startup, **depends on:**

* **JVM version** (Java 8, 11, 17, 21… may differ).
* **GC algorithm** in use.
* **JVM options** (`-XX:+UseParallelGC`, `-XX:CICompilerCount=2`, etc.).
* **OS & hardware** (more CPUs → more GC/JIT threads).:

1. **Main thread**

   * Runs your `public static void main(String[] args)` method.

2. **Reference Handler**

   * Cleans up references like `PhantomReference`, `WeakReference`, `SoftReference`.

3. **Finalizer**

   * Runs finalizers on objects that are about to be garbage-collected (deprecated in recent JDKs, but still present in some versions).

4. **Signal Dispatcher**

   * Handles signals sent to the JVM process (e.g., CTRL+C, or OS signals).

5. **GC threads**

   * Depends on the garbage collector chosen by the JVM.
   * For example:

     * **G1GC** (default since JDK 9) → multiple GC worker threads + concurrent marking threads.
     * **Parallel GC** → several GC threads.
     * **Serial GC** → just one GC thread.

6. **JIT compiler threads**

   * The JVM’s Just-In-Time compiler (C2, Tiered compilation, Graal) spins up background threads to compile bytecode into machine code.

7. **Attach Listener**

   * Used when tools (like VisualVM, JConsole, profilers) connect to the JVM.


You can print all threads at JVM startup with:

```java
public class ThreadCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet()
              .forEach(t -> System.out.println(t.getName()));
    }
}
```

On a simple run, you’ll usually see something like:

```
main
Reference Handler
Finalizer
Signal Dispatcher
Common-Cleaner
Attach Listener
GC Thread#0
GC Thread#1
...
C2 CompilerThread0
C2 CompilerThread1
```
