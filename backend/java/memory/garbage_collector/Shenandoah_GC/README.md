Sure! Let’s dive into **Shenandoah GC**, which is another **low-pause-time garbage collector** in Java. I’ll explain it clearly, including **architecture, phases, and differences from G1 and ZGC**.

## **1️⃣ Overview**

| Feature           | **Shenandoah GC**                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Introduced        | Java 12 (early preview), Java 14+ production         |
| GC Type           | **Concurrent, Region-based, Compacting**             |
| Pause Times       | Typically **few milliseconds**, even for large heaps |
| Heap Layout       | Divided into **regions** (\~1 MB default)            |
| Generational      | **Yes**, supports young and old regions              |
| Concurrent Phases | Concurrent marking, concurrent compaction            |
| Compaction        | **Concurrent**, reduces fragmentation                |
| Tuning            | Minimal tuning; supports `-XX:PauseTimeTargetMillis` |

**Goal**: Like ZGC, Shenandoah aims to **keep GC pauses extremely low** while still handling large heaps.

## **2️⃣ How Shenandoah Works**

### **Heap Layout**

* Heap is divided into **regions**, similar to G1.
* Both **young and old generations** exist.

### **Key Phases**

1. **Concurrent Marking**

   * Identify **live objects**.
   * Runs **concurrently with application threads**.

2. **Concurrent Evacuation / Relocation**

   * Moves live objects to free regions **concurrently**, unlike G1, which pauses during evacuation.
   * Uses **remembered sets** to track cross-region references.

3. **Concurrent Compaction**

   * Frees empty regions **without a long stop-the-world pause**.
   * Reduces fragmentation automatically.

4. **Young GC**

   * Minor collections happen, usually **short pauses**.
   * Shenandoah may still pause briefly to process card tables.

## **3️⃣ Pause Times**

| GC Phase                | Pause Time |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Concurrent Mark         | Few ms     |
| Evacuation / Relocation | Few ms     |
| Compaction              | Few ms     |
| Young GC                | \~1–10 ms  |

**Overall**: Shenandoah **keeps pause times almost constant**, even as heap size increases.

## **4️⃣ Tuning Shenandoah**

* `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC` → enable Shenandoah.
* `-XX:ShenandoahPauses=<ms>` → target pause time, e.g., 10 ms.
* `-XX:ShenandoahRegionSize=<size>` → adjust region size.
* Minimal tuning is needed; designed to **self-adjust for low latency**.

## **5️⃣ Comparison: G1 vs ZGC vs Shenandoah**

| Feature               | G1           | ZGC                           | Shenandoah               |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pause Time            | 10–200 ms    | <10 ms                        | Few ms                   |
| Concurrent Compaction | Partial      | Fully                         | Fully                    |
| Heap Size             | Medium-large | Multi-TB                      | Large                    |
| Generational          | Yes          | No strict gen                 | Yes                      |
| Tuning                | Needed       | Minimal                       | Minimal                  |
| Use Case              | General      | Ultra-low-latency, huge heaps | Low-latency, large heaps |

## **6️⃣ Key Takeaways**

* Shenandoah is **low-pause, concurrent GC**, similar to ZGC.
* It is **region-based and generational**, unlike ZGC.
* Compaction is **mostly concurrent**, reducing fragmentation.
* Best for **latency-sensitive applications** where you want predictable pauses but might not need multi-terabyte heap support.

If you want, I can also create a **Mermaid diagram of Shenandoah GC phases**, similar to what we did for G1 and ZGC, showing **concurrent marking, relocation, and compaction**, which makes it very intuitive visually.

Do you want me to do that?
