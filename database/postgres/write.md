### **How PostgreSQL Writes Data to the File System**  

PostgreSQL follows a **multi-step process** for writing data to the file system while ensuring **durability, crash recovery, and performance**. It uses **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** and **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** to handle transactions efficiently.

---

## **1. PostgreSQL Write Path (Step-by-Step)**  
When a new record is inserted:  
1. **Write to WAL (Write-Ahead Log) ‚Äì Ensures durability**  
2. **Modify Shared Buffers (In-Memory)**  
3. **Background Writer Flushes Dirty Pages to Disk**  
4. **Checkpoint Writes Data to Disk Periodically**  
5. **Vacuum Removes Old Versions (MVCC Cleanup)**  

---

## **2. Step-by-Step Breakdown of Writes**

### **Step 1: Write to Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**
- **Every write operation is first logged** in the **WAL (pg_wal directory)**.
- The WAL is an **append-only sequential log** that ensures data **can be recovered after crashes**.
- This **prevents direct writes to the main data files** on every transaction.

‚úÖ **Fast (sequential writes, minimal disk I/O)**  
‚úÖ **Crash recovery (logs can be replayed to restore lost data)**  

üí° **Example WAL Entry**
```
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (101, 'Alice', 60000);
```
Stored in WAL like:
```
{LSN: 12345, Table: employees, Key: 101, Data: ('Alice', 60000)}
```

üí° **WAL Location:**
```bash
ls $PGDATA/pg_wal/
```

---

### **Step 2: Modify Shared Buffers (In-Memory)**
- PostgreSQL **does not immediately write data to disk**.
- Instead, changes are **made in Shared Buffers (RAM)**.
- These modified pages are called **dirty pages**.

‚úÖ **Fast (avoids disk writes for every transaction)**  
‚ùå **Data loss risk (until WAL is flushed to disk)**  

üí° **Check Shared Buffers**
```sql
SHOW shared_buffers;
```

---

### **Step 3: Background Writer Flushes Dirty Pages to Disk**
- The **Background Writer** process periodically writes dirty pages from **Shared Buffers** to **heap files** on disk.
- This is an **asynchronous operation** to reduce latency.

‚úÖ **Efficient (avoids frequent disk writes)**  

üí° **View Background Writer Activity**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
```

---

### **Step 4: Checkpoint Writes Data to Disk (FSync)**
- At **checkpoints**, PostgreSQL forces all **dirty pages** and **WAL segments** to be **flushed to disk**.
- A checkpoint occurs **every few minutes** or after a set amount of WAL data.

‚úÖ **Ensures data is safely written to disk**  
‚úÖ **Allows WAL logs to be cleared (preventing excessive growth)**  

üí° **Trigger a Checkpoint Manually**
```sql
CHECKPOINT;
```

---

### **Step 5: VACUUM Removes Old Versions (MVCC Cleanup)**
- PostgreSQL uses **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**.
- **Old versions of rows remain** in the table after updates/deletes.
- The **VACUUM** process **removes outdated row versions** to free space.

‚úÖ **Prevents table bloat**  
‚úÖ **Speeds up queries**  

üí° **Check Autovacuum Activity**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_all_tables WHERE relname = 'employees';
```

üí° **Run Manual VACUUM**
```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE employees;
```

## **3. Summary: How PostgreSQL Handles Writes**
| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1** | Write to **WAL (pg_wal)** | Crash recovery & durability |
| **2** | Modify **Shared Buffers (RAM)** | Fast transactions, avoids direct disk writes |
| **3** | **Background Writer** flushes pages | Periodic disk writes to reduce latency |
| **4** | **Checkpoint** forces data to disk | Ensures data is fully written |
| **5** | **VACUUM removes old rows** | Cleans up storage for performance |

---

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Efficient Writes** ‚Üí **WAL avoids frequent disk writes**.  
- **Crash Recovery** ‚Üí WAL allows replaying lost transactions.  
- **Read Performance** ‚Üí **MVCC allows concurrent reads without blocking**.

### **Comparison: PostgreSQL WAL vs. Cassandra Commit Log**  

Both **PostgreSQL** and **Cassandra** use **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) or Commit Logs** to ensure durability, but they have **different architectures and trade-offs**.

---

## **1. Key Differences Between WAL (PostgreSQL) and Commit Log (Cassandra)**  

| Feature            | PostgreSQL WAL | Cassandra Commit Log |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Ensures **ACID compliance**, crash recovery, and replication | Ensures **durable writes**, crash recovery, and replication |
| **Write Location** | WAL entries are **stored in `pg_wal/`** directory | Commit Log entries are **stored in `commitlog/`** directory |
| **Write Mode** | Append-only **sequential writes** | Append-only **sequential writes** |
| **Flush Mechanism** | WAL logs are flushed at **checkpoints or fsync** | Commit Log is flushed **when full or every few seconds** |
| **Data Structure** | Logs changes at the **row level** (per transaction) | Logs changes at the **partition level** (per write) |
| **Read Dependency** | **Must replay WAL** on startup if crash occurs | **Not used for reads** (data is read from Memtable or SSTables) |
| **Log Retention** | Old WAL segments **are removed after a checkpoint** | Old Commit Log segments **are removed after Memtable flush** |
| **Compaction** | **VACUUM removes old tuples** | **Compaction merges SSTables, removes tombstones** |

---

## **2. How They Work: PostgreSQL WAL vs. Cassandra Commit Log**  

### **A. PostgreSQL WAL (Write-Ahead Log)**
- Every **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** operation **first writes an entry** to the WAL before modifying data in Shared Buffers.
- WAL ensures that even if the database crashes, transactions **can be replayed from the logs**.
- **Checkpoints** periodically flush dirty pages from memory to disk.

üí° **Example: WAL Log Entry**
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (101, 'Alice', 60000);
```
Stored in WAL as:
```
LSN: 12345, Action: INSERT, Table: employees, Key: 101, Data: ('Alice', 60000)
```

**Flush Timing:**
- WAL logs are **flushed after every transaction** (default).
- Checkpoints occur **every few minutes** or **after a set amount of WAL data**.

---

### **B. Cassandra Commit Log**
- Every write first **appends to the Commit Log** before writing to the **Memtable (RAM)**.
- Unlike PostgreSQL, the Commit Log **does not store full SQL-level transactions**‚Äîit only logs **partition-level changes**.
- Once the **Memtable is full**, its contents are flushed to **SSTables**, and the corresponding Commit Log segment is deleted.

üí° **Example: Commit Log Entry**
```cql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (101, 'Alice', 60000);
```
Stored in Commit Log as:
```
Partition Key: 101, Column: name, Value: 'Alice'
```

**Flush Timing:**
- The Commit Log is **flushed when it reaches a size threshold**.
- Logs are **removed** once data is persisted in **SSTables**.

---

## **3. Performance & Trade-Offs**  

| Factor          | PostgreSQL WAL | Cassandra Commit Log |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Write Speed** | Slower (ACID compliance, fsync overhead) | Faster (Append-only writes, eventual consistency) |
| **Read Speed** | Faster (MVCC allows indexed lookups) | Slower (Data is spread across SSTables, requiring compaction) |
| **Durability** | High (Transactions survive crashes, WAL can replay logs) | High (Writes survive crashes, but reads might need compaction) |
| **Storage Overhead** | Moderate (WAL + heap tables) | High (Commit Logs + multiple SSTables before compaction) |
| **Scalability** | **Best for transactional workloads** | **Best for write-heavy, distributed workloads** |

---

## **4. WAL vs. Commit Log in a Distributed System**
| Feature | PostgreSQL (WAL) | Cassandra (Commit Log) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Replication** | WAL-based replication (Streaming WAL to replicas) | Commit Log is local; **replication happens at the partition level** |
| **Node Failure Handling** | WAL allows replaying lost transactions | Commit Log is **not shared across nodes** (replication ensures durability) |
| **Consistency Model** | **Strong consistency (ACID transactions)** | **Eventual consistency (CAP Theorem)** |

---

## **5. Which One Should You Use?**
- **Use PostgreSQL if:**  
  ‚úÖ You need **ACID transactions**  
  ‚úÖ You have **read-heavy workloads**  
  ‚úÖ You need **structured relational data**  

- **Use Cassandra if:**  
  ‚úÖ You have **high write throughput**  
  ‚úÖ You need **horizontal scalability (NoSQL, distributed system)**  
  ‚úÖ You can tolerate **eventual consistency**  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **PostgreSQL WAL is best for transactional consistency and durability.**
- **Cassandra Commit Log is optimized for fast writes but relies on Memtables and SSTables for reads.**
- **PostgreSQL has stricter durability guarantees, while Cassandra sacrifices strict consistency for scalability.**
