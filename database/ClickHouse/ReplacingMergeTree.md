### **ReplacingMergeTree in ClickHouse: Overview and Examples**

`ReplacingMergeTree` is an engine in ClickHouse used to **deduplicate rows** based on a **primary key** and optionally a **version column**. It is ideal for use cases where rows may be **inserted multiple times**, and you only want to retain the **latest version**.

---

### **Key Characteristics**

- Inherits from `MergeTree`
- During background merges, it keeps **only the latest row per primary key**
- Uses an **optional version column** (e.g., timestamp or revision number) to decide which row is “latest”
- Without version column: deduplication is **non-deterministic** — one row per key is kept, but which one may vary

---

### **Creating a Table with ReplacingMergeTree**

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_logins
(
    user_id UInt64,
    login_time DateTime,
    device String,
    version UInt64
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(version)
ORDER BY user_id;
```

- `ORDER BY user_id` — defines how the data is sorted and grouped for deduplication
- `version` — used to pick the latest record when duplicates are found

---

### **Insert Example Data**

```sql
INSERT INTO user_logins VALUES (1, '2024-01-01 10:00:00', 'Laptop', 1);
INSERT INTO user_logins VALUES (1, '2024-01-01 11:00:00', 'Phone', 2);
INSERT INTO user_logins VALUES (2, '2024-01-01 09:00:00', 'Tablet', 1);
INSERT INTO user_logins VALUES (2, '2024-01-01 10:00:00', 'Phone', 2);
```

Here, each user has 2 records, but we want only the latest per user.

---

### **Query With Deduplication**

By default, ClickHouse doesn’t deduplicate on read — it happens during background merges or if explicitly requested:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_logins FINAL;
```

**Output:**

| user_id | login_time         | device | version |
|---------|--------------------|--------|---------|
| 1       | 2024-01-01 11:00:00| Phone  | 2       |
| 2       | 2024-01-01 10:00:00| Phone  | 2       |

> The `FINAL` keyword forces deduplication at read time (expensive).

---

### **Without Version Column**

```sql
CREATE TABLE raw_logs
(
    event_id UInt64,
    message String
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
ORDER BY event_id;
```

This will keep **one record per `event_id`**, but it's **non-deterministic** which one remains if multiple are inserted.

---

### **Best Use Cases**

- Slowly changing dimensions
- Log ingestion with idempotency
- CDC (Change Data Capture) where updates are done by inserting new rows
