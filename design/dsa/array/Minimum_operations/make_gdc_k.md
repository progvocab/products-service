 **“Minimum operations to make GCD of array a multiple of k”**.

---

### 🔹 Problem Restatement

You are given:

* An array `a[]` of integers.
* A number `k`.

You can perform operations (usually *replacing elements* or *incrementing/decrementing* — depending on the problem definition).
The goal: **Make the GCD of the entire array divisible by `k` using the minimum operations.**

---

### 🔹 Key Observations

1. The GCD of the array must divide all elements.

   * So for the final GCD to be divisible by `k`, **all array elements must become divisible by some divisor `d` of `k`.**

2. The natural choice is to try making **all numbers divisible by `k`** itself, because then GCD will be multiple of `k`.

3. **Operation definition** (most common form in problems):

   * Replace an element with another number (count = 1 operation).
   * Or, make an element divisible by `k` (count minimal operations per element).

---

### 🔹 Approach 1: Replace with nearest multiple of `k`

For each element `a[i]`:

* Either increase to the next multiple of `k`
* Or decrease to the previous multiple of `k`.

Cost per element:

$$
\text{cost}(a[i]) = \min(a[i] \bmod k,\; k - (a[i] \bmod k))
$$

Then:

$$
\text{answer} = \min \left( \sum \text{cost}(a[i]) \right)
$$

---

### 🔹 Example

**Input:**

```
a = [10, 14, 22], k = 6
```

* For `10`: remainder = `10 % 6 = 4`. Cost = min(4, 6-4=2) = **2**.
* For `14`: remainder = `14 % 6 = 2`. Cost = min(2, 6-2=4) = **2**.
* For `22`: remainder = `22 % 6 = 4`. Cost = min(4, 2) = **2**.

Total operations = 2 + 2 + 2 = **6**.

So we need at least **6 operations**.

---

### 🔹 Optimized Idea

Instead of making all divisible by `k`, sometimes making them divisible by a **factor of k** is cheaper.
So:

1. Find divisors of `k`.
2. For each divisor `d`, compute:

   $$
   \text{cost}_d = \sum_i \min(a[i] \bmod d,\; d - (a[i] \bmod d))
   $$
3. Answer = min over all divisors.

---

### 🔹 Python Solution

```python
import math

def min_ops_make_gcd_multiple(arr, k):
    # find all divisors of k
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(k)) + 1):
        if k % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(k // i)
    
    ans = float('inf')
    for d in divisors:
        cost = 0
        for x in arr:
            r = x % d
            cost += min(r, d - r)
        ans = min(ans, cost)
    return ans

# Example
print(min_ops_make_gcd_multiple([10, 14, 22], 6))  # Output: 6
```

✅ This ensures we always get the **minimum operations**.

---

 **variant where only replacing an element counts as 1 operation (not increments/decrements)**? That one has a very different answer.

---

the **variant where a single operation = replace one element (with any integer)**.

# Answer

**Key observation (simple and crucial):**
If the final GCD of the array is a multiple of `k`, then that GCD divides every array element. Hence **every element** in the final array must be divisible by `k`. Therefore any original element that is **not divisible by `k` must be replaced** at least once. Conversely, if you replace all elements that are not divisible by `k` with multiples of `k`, the array's GCD will be a multiple of `k` (because every element will be divisible by `k`).

So the minimum number of replacements = **count of elements in `a` that are not divisible by `k`**.

# Complexity

We only scan the array once: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** extra space.

# Python code

```python
def min_replacements_to_make_gcd_multiple(arr, k):
    # each element not divisible by k must be replaced
    return sum(1 for x in arr if x % k != 0)

# Example
a = [10, 14, 22]
k = 6
# elements %6 !=0 are all three -> answer = 3
print(min_replacements_to_make_gcd_multiple(a, k))  # 3
```

If you want, I can also:

* show a small proof sketch,
* handle edge cases (k = 0 or negative k), or
* adapt for the other operation-cost models (like changing by ±1 per op) — but you already have that earlier. Which would you like next?
