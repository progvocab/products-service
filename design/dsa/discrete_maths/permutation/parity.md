 **parity of a permutation** is another place where group theory shows up in competitive programming.

# ðŸ”¹ What is Permutation Parity?

* A **permutation** can be written as a product of **swaps (transpositions)**.
* If it takes an **even number of swaps** â†’ permutation is **even**.
* If it takes an **odd number of swaps** â†’ permutation is **odd**.

ðŸ‘‰ Parity is very important:

* Itâ€™s invariant: you cannot change an even permutation into odd just by rearranging swaps.
* Used in puzzles like the **15-puzzle**, Rubikâ€™s cube, etc.

---

# ðŸ”¹ How to Compute Parity?

There are a few equivalent methods:

### 1. **Count Inversions**

* Inversion = pair `(i, j)` with `i < j` but `A[i] > A[j]`.
* If the inversion count is **even** â†’ permutation is even.
* If odd â†’ permutation is odd.

### 2. **Cycle Decomposition**

* Break permutation into disjoint cycles.
* Parity = `(n âˆ’ number_of_cycles) mod 2`.

Both are correct. Letâ€™s do Python code for both.

# âœ… Python Implementation

```python
def permutation_parity_inversions(perm):
    """Return +1 for even, -1 for odd using inversion count"""
    n = len(perm)
    inversions = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if perm[i] > perm[j]:
                inversions += 1
    return 1 if inversions % 2 == 0 else -1


def permutation_parity_cycles(perm):
    """Return +1 for even, -1 for odd using cycle decomposition"""
    n = len(perm)
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = perm[j]  # follow cycle
            cycles += 1
    
    return 1 if (n - cycles) % 2 == 0 else -1


# Example permutations
perm1 = [2, 0, 1]   # permutation of [0,1,2]
perm2 = [1, 0, 2]   # just one swap of (0,1)

print("By inversions:")
print(permutation_parity_inversions(perm1))  # +1 â†’ even
print(permutation_parity_inversions(perm2))  # -1 â†’ odd

print("\nBy cycles:")
print(permutation_parity_cycles(perm1))      # +1 â†’ even
print(permutation_parity_cycles(perm2))      # -1 â†’ odd
```

---

# ðŸ”Ž Example Walkthrough

* `perm2 = [1,0,2]` (swap of first two elements):

  * Inversions = 1 â†’ odd â†’ parity = -1.
  * Cycles = (0 1)(2) â†’ 3 elements, 2 cycles â†’ `3-2 = 1` odd â†’ parity = -1.

Both methods agree âœ…

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also show how **permutation parity is used in problems like checking solvability of the 15-puzzle** (a classic CP + math application)?

The parity of a permutation can be determined by counting the number of inversions or by analyzing its cycle decomposition. 
Method 1: Counting Inversions 
An inversion in a permutation $\pi$ is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ but  $\pi(i) > \pi(j)$ . A permutation is even if it has an even number of inversions, and odd if it has an odd number of inversions. 
```python 
def get_parity_inversions(permutation):
    """
    Calculates the parity of a permutation based on the number of inversions.

    Args:
        permutation: A list representing the permutation (e.g., [0, 2, 1, 3] for (0 2 1 3)).

    Returns:
        0 for even parity, 1 for odd parity.
    """
    inversions = 0
    n = len(permutation)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if permutation[i] > permutation[j]:
                inversions += 1
    return inversions % 2

# Example usage:
perm1 = [0, 2, 1, 3]  # (0 2 1 3) - inversion (2,1)
print(f"Parity of {perm1} (inversions): {get_parity_inversions(perm1)}")

perm2 = [1, 0, 3, 2]  # (1 0 3 2) - inversions (1,0), (3,2)
print(f"Parity of {perm2} (inversions): {get_parity_inversions(perm2)}")
```
Method 2: Cycle Decomposition 
Every permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles. The parity of a permutation is the sum of the parities of its cycles. The parity of a cycle of length $k$ is $(k-1) \pmod 2$. [1]  
```python 
def get_parity_cycles(permutation):
    """
    Calculates the parity of a permutation based on its cycle decomposition.

    Args:
        permutation: A list representing the permutation (e.g., [0, 2, 1, 3] for (0 2 1 3)).

    Returns:
        0 for even parity, 1 for odd parity.
    """
    n = len(permutation)
    visited = [False] * n
    num_cycles = 0
    total_length = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            num_cycles += 1
            current = i
            cycle_length = 0
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = permutation[current]
                cycle_length += 1
            total_length += cycle_length

    # Parity is (n - num_cycles) % 2
    # Or, equivalently, sum of (k-1) for each cycle
    return (n - num_cycles) % 2

# Example usage:
perm1 = [0, 2, 1, 3]  # Cycles: (0)(1 2)(3) - n=4, num_cycles=3
print(f"Parity of {perm1} (cycles): {get_parity_cycles(perm1)}")

perm2 = [1, 0, 3, 2]  # Cycles: (0 1)(2 3) - n=4, num_cycles=2
print(f"Parity of {perm2} (cycles): {get_parity_cycles(perm2)}")
```
