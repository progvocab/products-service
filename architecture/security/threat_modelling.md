# **Threat Modeling: Understanding & Methodologies**  

## **What is Threat Modeling?**  
Threat modeling is a **proactive security practice** that helps identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security threats **before they are exploited**. It is used to evaluate **system vulnerabilities**, assess **attack vectors**, and **prioritize security controls** during **software development, cloud security, and infrastructure design**.

---

## **Why is Threat Modeling Important?**  
✅ Helps identify **vulnerabilities early** in the development lifecycle.  
✅ Reduces the **cost of fixing security issues** later.  
✅ Enhances **compliance** with security standards like **ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, HIPAA**.  
✅ Improves **application security posture** against cyber threats.  
✅ Strengthens **incident response** by anticipating attack patterns.

# **Threat Modeling Methodologies**  

There are **multiple methodologies** for threat modeling, each suited for **different use cases**.  

## **1. STRIDE (Microsoft)**  
**STRIDE** is a widely used **threat classification framework** developed by **Microsoft**. It helps identify **six categories of threats** in a system.  

| **Threat Type** | **Description** | **Example Attack** | **Mitigation** |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **S**poofing | Impersonating another user or system | Fake login page | Multi-factor authentication (MFA), Secure identity management |
| **T**ampering | Modifying data or code | SQL injection, modifying API responses | Input validation, data integrity checks (hashing, digital signatures) |
| **R**epudiation | Denying an action occurred | A user deletes logs to hide fraud | Audit logging, non-repudiation mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures) |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exposing sensitive data | Data leaks, unencrypted traffic | Encryption (TLS, AES), access control |
| **D**enial of Service (DoS) | Overloading or crashing a system | DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion | Rate limiting, WAF, auto-scaling |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining higher-level access | Exploiting admin privileges | Role-based access control (RBAC), Principle of Least Privilege |

✅ **Best for:** Application security, software development lifecycle (SDLC), cloud security.  
✅ **Tooling:** Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon.

## **2. PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**  
PASTA is a **risk-centric** threat modeling approach that **aligns security risks with business impact**.  

### **PASTA Framework - 7 Steps**  
1. **Define business objectives** – What is the system's purpose?  
2. **Define technical scope** – Identify architecture, APIs, and dependencies.  
3. **Application decomposition** – Understand data flow, inputs, and user interactions.  
4. **Threat analysis** – Identify potential attack scenarios.  
5. **Vulnerability detection** – Use penetration testing, security scanning.  
6. **Attack modeling** – Simulate attack scenarios (DDoS, ransomware, SQL injection).  
7. **Mitigation & Countermeasures** – Apply security controls.  

✅ **Best for:** Enterprise applications, financial services, regulatory compliance.  
✅ **Tooling:** ThreatModeler, IriusRisk.

## **3. LINDDUN (Privacy-Focused Threat Modeling)**  
LINDDUN is designed for **privacy threat modeling**, helping organizations comply with **GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA**.  

| **Threat Type** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **L**inkability | Users can be linked across datasets |
| **I**dentifiability | Users can be uniquely identified |
| **N**on-repudiation | Users cannot deny actions |
| **D**etectability | Unauthorized users can detect system behavior |
| **D**isclosure | Private information is exposed |
| **U**nwanted tracking | Users are tracked without consent |
| **N**on-compliance | The system violates privacy regulations |

✅ **Best for:** Privacy risk assessments, GDPR compliance, data protection.  
✅ **Tooling:** OWASP Threat Dragon, IriusRisk.  

---

## **4. DREAD (Risk-Based Threat Modeling)**  
DREAD is a **quantitative threat modeling** methodology that ranks threats based on **risk impact**.  

### **DREAD Scoring (1-10 for each category)**  
1. **Damage Potential** – How bad is the attack?  
2. **Reproducibility** – How easily can it be exploited?  
3. **Exploitability** – How complex is the attack?  
4. **Affected Users** – How many users are impacted?  
5. **Discoverability** – How easy is it to find the vulnerability?  

### **Example DREAD Score Calculation**  
| Threat | Damage | Reproducibility | Exploitability | Affected Users | Discoverability | **Total Score** |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| SQL Injection | 9 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 10 | **46** |
| DDoS Attack | 6 | 7 | 8 | 10 | 5 | **36** |

✅ **Best for:** Quantifying security risks, risk-based decision-making.  
✅ **Tooling:** Manual risk scoring using Excel, IriusRisk.  

---

## **5. VAST (Visual, Agile & Simple Threat Modeling)**  
VAST is **automation-friendly** and suited for **DevSecOps & Agile environments**.  

- Uses **visual diagrams** instead of textual analysis.  
- Integrates with **CI/CD pipelines** for automated security assessments.  
- Helps model threats at **application-level & infrastructure-level**.  

✅ **Best for:** Agile DevOps teams, cloud-native applications.  
✅ **Tooling:** ThreatModeler.

# **Comparison of Threat Modeling Methods**  

| **Methodology** | **Best For** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|---------------|------------|-------|-------|
| **STRIDE** | Application security | Easy to understand, widely adopted | Doesn't prioritize risks quantitatively |
| **PASTA** | Enterprise security, regulatory compliance | Business-aligned, risk-centric | Requires deep business knowledge |
| **LINDDUN** | Privacy risk assessment | GDPR/CCPA compliance, data protection | Not focused on broader security threats |
| **DREAD** | Risk quantification | Helps prioritize security risks | Subjective scoring can vary |
| **VAST** | DevOps, automation | CI/CD integration, automated threat modeling | Tooling dependency |

# **How to Perform Threat Modeling in a Real-World Scenario**  

### **Scenario:** Securing an E-Commerce API  
You are developing an **e-commerce system** that processes **payments, stores user data**, and interacts with **third-party payment gateways**.

### **Threat Modeling Process:**  

✅ **1. Identify Key Components**  
- User authentication (OAuth2, JWT)  
- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)  
- Database (PostgreSQL, Redis)  
- APIs (GraphQL, REST)  

✅ **2. Apply STRIDE for Threat Identification**  

| **Component** | **Threat Type** | **Example Attack** | **Mitigation** |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Login API** | Spoofing | Brute-force login | MFA, rate limiting |
| **Payment API** | Tampering | Man-in-the-middle attack | TLS 1.3 encryption, secure API keys |
| **User Database** | Information Disclosure | SQL Injection | Input sanitization, WAF |
| **Order System** | Denial of Service | Bot-based spam orders | Captcha, DDoS protection |
| **Admin Panel** | Elevation of Privilege | Stolen admin credentials | RBAC, strong password policies |

✅ **3. Prioritize Threats (DREAD Method)**  
- High-risk threats → Immediate mitigation  
- Medium-risk threats → Monitor & plan fixes  
- Low-risk threats → Document & re-evaluate later  

✅ **4. Implement Security Controls**  
- Use **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for **API protection**.  
- Implement **IAM roles & least privilege access** for databases.  
- Enable **TLS encryption & data masking** for sensitive data.
