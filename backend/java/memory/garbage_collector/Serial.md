Perfect ðŸ‘Œ Letâ€™s go step by step with **Serial Garbage Collector (GC)** in Java, how it works, how the heap is divided, and what other memory areas exist in the JVM.

# 1. **Serial Garbage Collector Overview**

* **Option**: `-XX:+UseSerialGC`
* **How it works**:

  * Uses a **single thread** for garbage collection (both young and old generations).
  * Always does **Stop-The-World (STW)** pauses: application threads stop until GC is done.
  * Simple, small footprint â†’ best for **single-core machines** or small heaps.

# 2. **Heap Division under Serial GC**

The JVM heap is divided into **generations** (generational GC model):

### ðŸ“Œ Heap Layout

```
+-----------------------------------+
| Young Generation                  |
|   - Eden                          |
|   - Survivor 0 (S0)               |
|   - Survivor 1 (S1)               |
+-----------------------------------+
| Old Generation (Tenured)          |
+-----------------------------------+
| Metaspace (Java 8+)               |
+-----------------------------------+
```

### **How it works**

1. **Young Generation (Eden + Survivor spaces)**

   * **Eden**: New objects are created here.
   * When Eden fills up â†’ *Minor GC* is triggered.
   * Live objects are copied **Eden â†’ Survivor (S0/S1)**.
   * Survivor spaces alternate (copying model).
   * Objects that survive multiple GCs are **promoted to Old Generation**.

2. **Old Generation (Tenured)**

   * Stores long-lived objects.
   * When full â†’ *Major GC (Full GC)* happens.
   * Uses **Mark-Sweep-Compact** algorithm:

     * **Mark**: Find live objects.
     * **Sweep**: Remove dead objects.
     * **Compact**: Move live objects together to eliminate fragmentation.

3. **Metaspace (Java 8+)**

   * Stores **class metadata** (before Java 8 this was in *PermGen*).
   * Grows dynamically (unlike fixed PermGen).
   * GC can unload classes when class loaders are discarded.

# 3. **Other Memory Areas in JVM**

Apart from Heap, JVM has several other memory regions:

| Memory Area                            | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heap**                               | Stores objects (Young Gen + Old Gen + Metaspace).                                 |
| **Method Area** (Metaspace in Java 8+) | Stores class structures, methods, constants.                                      |
| **Stack**                              | Each thread has its own stack; stores method frames, local variables, references. |
| **Program Counter (PC) Register**      | Each thread has a PC register holding the current instruction address.            |
| **Native Method Stack**                | Used by native methods (C/C++ libraries via JNI).                                 |
| **Code Cache**                         | Stores JIT-compiled bytecode (machine instructions).                              |

# 4. **Serial GC Algorithms**

* **Minor GC (Young Gen collection)**: Copying collector â†’ live objects copied to survivor spaces.
* **Major/Full GC (Old Gen collection)**: Mark-Sweep-Compact â†’ ensures no fragmentation.

---

âœ… **In summary**:

* **Serial GC** â†’ single-threaded, stop-the-world, best for small heaps.
* **Heap division**: Eden + Survivor + Old Gen + Metaspace.
* **Other areas**: Stack, PC Register, Native Stack, Code Cache.

Would you like me to **draw a diagram with arrows showing how objects move (Eden â†’ Survivor â†’ Old Gen)** during GC for Serial Collector? That gives a clear picture of object lifecycle.
