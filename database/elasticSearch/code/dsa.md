 OpenSearch (like Elasticsearch, since it was forked from it) uses a number of **graph and tree-based algorithms** internally for indexing, searching, and cluster management. Letâ€™s break it down.

# ðŸ”¹ Tree Structures in OpenSearch

1. **Inverted Index Trees**

   * Core data structure for text search.
   * Terms are stored in a **prefix tree (trie-like FST: Finite State Transducer)** for efficient prefix, wildcard, and regex queries.
   * Enables fast **term lookup** and auto-complete.

2. **BKD Trees (Block KD-Tree)**

   * Used for numeric, geospatial, and range queries.
   * High-dimensional data structure similar to KD-Trees but optimized for **disk-based storage**.
   * Example: Searching documents with latitude/longitude ranges.

3. **B+ Trees (Lucene Segment Files)**

   * Inside Apache Lucene (the search library powering OpenSearch), posting lists and term dictionaries use **B+ treeâ€“like structures** for efficient sequential and random access.

# ðŸ”¹ Graph Structures in OpenSearch

1. **Cluster State & Routing**

   * OpenSearch cluster maintains a **graph of nodes and shards**.
   * Master node runs coordination algorithms (similar to **graph traversal**) to decide shard allocation and rebalancing.

2. **Graph Queries (OpenSearch Graph Plugin)**

   * Enables **entity-relationship exploration** on indexed data.
   * Internally uses **graph traversal algorithms** (like BFS/DFS) over inverted indices.

3. **Query Execution DAG**

   * A search request is represented as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of query phases:

     * Parse â†’ Rewrite â†’ Execute â†’ Merge â†’ Rank
   * Similar to an execution plan in databases.

# ðŸ”¹ Algorithms Used

* **DFS/BFS** â†’ traversing query plans, graph plugin exploration.
* **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** â†’ used in cluster coordination for detecting partitioned nodes / resolving shard allocation conflicts.
* **Priority Queues (Heaps)** â†’ for Top-K document scoring.
* **Greedy / Scheduling Algorithms** â†’ shard allocation and rebalancing.
* **Trie/FST Construction Algorithms** â†’ for efficient term dictionary building.
* **KD-Tree Splitting Algorithms** â†’ for spatial/numeric index partitioning.

---

âœ… **Summary**:

* **Trees**: Tries/FST, BKD Trees, B+ Trees.
* **Graphs**: Cluster state graph, query execution DAG, Graph plugin traversals.
* **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Union-Find, Priority Queues, Scheduling, KD-tree splits.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to make a **visual diagram** showing how OpenSearch uses trees for indexing (per-shard FST/BKD) and graphs for query execution + cluster routing? That might help connect the theory to OpenSearch internals.
