## 1. Longest Palindrome
---
```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    if not s:
        return ""
    
    start, end = 0, 0  # track longest palindrome bounds

    def expandAroundCenter(left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        # return bounds of palindrome (excluding overshoot)
        return left + 1, right - 1

    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Odd length palindrome
        l1, r1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i)
        # Even length palindrome
        l2, r2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)

        # choose longer
        if r1 - l1 > end - start:
            start, end = l1, r1
        if r2 - l2 > end - start:
            start, end = l2, r2

    return s[start:end + 1]

## 2. Longest Common Prefix 

```python 

def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Start with the first string as prefix
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for s in strs[1:]:
        # Reduce prefix until it matches the start of s
        while not s.startswith(prefix):
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
            if not prefix:
                return ""
    
    return prefix


# Example usage
print(longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"]))  # "fl"
print(longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"]))     # ""

```
