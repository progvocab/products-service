Generate a Random Number in a Given Range

Question asks for generating a random integer or float between min and max.

Generate N Unique Random Numbers

Often implemented using sets, shuffling, or reservoir sampling.

Shuffle an Array or List Randomly

Requires Fisher–Yates algorithm or built-in shuffle.

Generate a Random Password

Mix uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols while ensuring constraints.

Generate a Random UUID

Uses secure RNG libraries or OS CSPRNG.

Monte Carlo Simulation Using Random Numbers

Used to approximate PI or probability distributions.

Randomly Select an Element From a List

Pick one or multiple items with or without replacement.

Weighted Random Selection

Choose an element based on weight distribution (roulette wheel selection).

Randomized QuickSort or Randomized Pivot Selection

Choose pivot randomly to avoid worst-case inputs.

Generate a Random Boolean With Specific Probability

Return true with p%, false with (100-p)%.

Create Cryptographically Secure Random Values

Use SecureRandom in Java or secrets in Python.

Seed a Random Number Generator

Control reproducibility and deterministic output.

Detect Random Number Pattern Bias

Check if a PRNG produces uniform or skewed results.

Random Sampling From Large Data Streams

Use reservoir sampling for memory-efficient selection.

Implement a Custom PRNG (LCG or XORShift)

Write your own simple PRNG and explain internal state updates.

Random Backoff Algorithm

Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries.

If you want, I can create Java, Python, or Linux/Kubernetes-specific examples for each question.
