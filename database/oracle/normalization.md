Alright, let's go deep into **database normalization**!

You gave me these sample columns and data:

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

Now, let's **apply all 6 Normal Forms** step by step:

---

# 1. **Unnormalized Form (UNF)**

- Raw table (repeating groups allowed)
- Reportees are not atomic (they are "Alex | Jenny" — multi-valued)

**Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

# 2. **First Normal Form (1NF)**

- **Atomic values only**.
- **No multi-valued attributes**.

**Fix:** Split reportees into multiple rows (or another table).

**Table (Option 1: Multiple Rows):**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportee | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex     | Manager     |
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Jenny    | Manager     |

**OR (Option 2: Create a separate Reportees Table):**

**Employees Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Manager     |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

# 3. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

- **Already in 1NF**
- **No partial dependency** on part of a composite key.

Since the primary key is just Employee Name (single field) or Employee ID if added, **and all non-key columns depend entirely** on it, **this satisfies 2NF**.

Nothing changes here.

---

# 4. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

- **No transitive dependencies** (i.e., non-key attribute → another non-key attribute).

**Possible Issue:**  
City may imply some attributes like State or Country (not given now). If city determines another attribute (e.g., state), split it.

**Otherwise**, current schema looks OK for 3NF.

---

# 5. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

- Stricter version of 3NF.
- Every determinant must be a candidate key.

Here, `Employee Name` uniquely identifies salary, city, designation, so no problem.

If `Designation` determines `Salary` (say all Managers always have salary 1000), we'd need to **separate Designation-Salary**:

**Designation Table (if needed):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

Then Employee Table:

| Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | New York | Manager     |

---

# 6. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- Deals with **multi-valued dependencies**.

**Problem:**  
Bob has **multiple reportees** independently.  
We already fixed this by creating a separate **Reportees Table** in 1NF.

Thus, 4NF is **already achieved**.

---

# 7. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- **Join dependency** — no lossless join issues.

Since we split Reportees properly, and there's no weird multi-table dependencies, it's fine.

If a complex relationship (e.g., Managers to Departments and Locations separately) existed, we'd split further.

---

# 8. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)** _(rarely used, but for completeness)_

- Decompose into **irreducible** tables based on time-variability.
- Used in temporal databases.

If Bob’s **Salary** changes over time, or **Designation** changes over time, you'd **timestamp** them:

**Employee Salary History Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| Bob           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

Similarly for Designation.

---

# **Summary Table**

| Normal Form | Action Taken |
|:------------|:-------------|
| UNF         | Original data with multi-values |
| 1NF         | Atomic fields (split reportees) |
| 2NF         | All non-key fields depend on the whole key |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency |
| BCNF        | No dependency anomalies |
| 4NF         | No multi-valued dependencies |
| 5NF         | No join dependencies |
| 6NF         | Temporal decomposition if needed |

---

# **Final Structure**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| 1           | Bob           | New York | Manager     |

**Salary History Table:**

| Employee ID | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| 1           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| 1           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

**Designation Table (Optional):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

# **Quick Visual**
```plaintext
Employee ---> Reportees (1:N)
Employee ---> SalaryHistory (1:N)
Employee ---> Designation (N:1)
```

Would you also like me to create an **ER Diagram** and **SQL script** for this normalized structure?  
(so you can directly visualize and implement it!)  
Let me know!  
It'll be very neat!

Good update!  
You added two new columns:

- **Zip Code**
- **Grade** (where Designation depends on Grade)

Now **dependencies** have become richer. Let’s rework **normalization** step-by-step.

---

# **New Table (Unnormalized / Raw Form)**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Reportees | Designation | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:------------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Alex\|Jenny | Manager     | A1   |

---

# **New Observations:**

- **City depends on Zip Code** (Zip → City)
- **Designation depends on Grade** (Grade → Designation)
- **Reportees** are multi-valued (Alex\|Jenny)
  
---

# **Normalization Steps**

## 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)** — Atomic Columns

**Problem:** Reportees column is multi-valued ("Alex | Jenny").  
**Fix:** Split reportees into a **separate table**.

---
**Employee Table (1NF):**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1   |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)** — Full Dependency on Key

Since the Employee table now uses **Employee ID** as Primary Key,  
each column depends entirely on Employee ID — no partial dependency.

No additional changes needed here.

---

## 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)** — No Transitive Dependencies

Now:

- `Zip Code` determines `City`
- `Grade` determines `Designation`

> This means **City** and **Designation** should be **moved into separate tables**, to remove transitive dependencies.

---

**New Structure for 3NF:**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1    |

---

**Zip Code Table:**

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |

---

**Grade Table:**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A1    | Manager     |

---

**Reportees Table (unchanged):**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

Every determinant must be a candidate key.  
✅ `Zip Code` uniquely determines `City`.  
✅ `Grade` uniquely determines `Designation`.

Hence after the above split, **BCNF is achieved**.

---

## 5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- No multi-valued dependency.
- Reportees are in a different table → good.
- No other multi-valued dependencies.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- No complex join dependencies.
- We have broken down the database logically.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 7. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)**

- Handle temporal data separately.
- If **Salary** or **Grade** or **Zip Code** changes over time, maintain a **history table**.

(Usually optional unless handling time-variant data)

---

# **Final Database Structure after Full Normalization**

### **Employee Table**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|

### **Zip Code Table**

| Zip Code | City |

### **Grade Table**

| Grade | Designation |

### **Reportees Table**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |

---

# **Dependencies (Functional Dependencies)**

| Dependency               | Meaning                     |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Zip Code → City           | Zip uniquely identifies City |
| Grade → Designation       | Grade uniquely identifies Designation |
| Employee ID → Salary, Zip, Grade, Name | Employee uniquely identifies other info |

---

# **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**

```
Employee (EmployeeID) 
    --> ZipCode (ZipCode) --> City
    --> Grade (Grade) --> Designation
    --> Reportees (ManagerID -> ReporteeName)
```

---

# **Summary of Changes due to New Columns:**

| Aspect           | Change made |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Multi-valued reportees | Split into separate Reportees table |
| Transitive dependency ZipCode → City | Moved City to separate ZipCode Table |
| Transitive dependency Grade → Designation | Moved Designation to separate Grade Table |
| Dependency simplification | Employee ID links all pieces of data cleanly |

---

# **Would you like me to also create:**

- SQL Scripts?
- Insert sample data?
- Show how queries would look after normalization?
- Show a Spring Data JPA Repository model for this?

It will give a full practical feel!  
Shall I continue? (it’ll be beautiful and very clear!)  
Let me know!
