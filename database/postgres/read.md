That’s a fantastic and deep question — exactly the kind of “under-the-hood” understanding that separates system users from system designers.

Let’s walk step-by-step through what happens inside **PostgreSQL** when a user fires a simple query such as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id = 1;
```

We’ll go from **SQL text → parser → executor → storage → visibility check**, showing every major internal subsystem that participates.

## 🧭 1️⃣ Entry Point: The Client & Postmaster

When you send a query from `psql` or a driver:

1. The **PostgreSQL client library (`libpq`)** sends the SQL command to the server over a TCP connection (port 5432).
2. The **Postmaster process** (the main PostgreSQL daemon) accepts the connection.
3. It **forks a backend process** (`postgres`) dedicated to that client session.

From now on, every query from your session is handled by that backend.

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ The SQL Processing Pipeline

### a. **Parser**

* Component: `parser/analyze.c`, `gram.y`
* Function: Converts the SQL text into a **parse tree**.
* Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id = 1;
  ```

  becomes an internal tree:

  ```
  SelectStmt
   ├── targetList → ['*']
   └── whereClause → (id = 1)
  ```

### b. **Analyzer / Rewriter**

* Checks:

  * Column existence
  * Data types
  * Expands `*` into actual columns
* Applies **query rewrite rules** (e.g., views, rules, INSTEAD OF triggers)

### c. **Planner / Optimizer**

* Component: `optimizer/`
* Chooses the best execution plan using:

  * **pg_class** (table stats)
  * **pg_statistic** (column histograms)
  * **pg_index**, **pg_attribute**
* Produces a **Plan Tree**:

  ```
  Index Scan using employee_pkey on employee  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1)
   Filter: (id = 1)
  ```

---

## 🧮 3️⃣ Executor (The Heart of Runtime)

The **executor** walks the plan nodes and fetches tuples.

Each node (e.g., Index Scan, Seq Scan, Filter, Sort) is a small state machine implementing:

```
ExecInitNode()   → initialize
ExecProcNode()   → get next tuple
ExecEndNode()    → cleanup
```

So `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id=1` may look like:

```
[Executor]
    ↓
[IndexScan Node]
    ↓
[Heap Fetch (row version)]
    ↓
[Visibility check (MVCC)]
    ↓
[Return tuple to client]
```

## 💾 4️⃣ Access Method Layer (AM Layer)

Two key access methods interact here:

| Layer        | Responsible For                              | Example Code                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Index AM** | Search in B-tree, hash, or GiST index        | `src/backend/access/nbtree/` |
| **Heap AM**  | Retrieve physical tuple (row) from heap file | `src/backend/access/heap/`   |

Example flow for an index lookup:

1. The **index** is consulted (`id = 1` → page & tuple offset).
2. It returns a **TID (Tuple Identifier)** — basically `(block number, offset)`.

---

## 📂 5️⃣ Buffer Manager & Shared Memory

The **Buffer Manager** ensures the required table or index page is in shared memory.

* Uses **Buffer Pool**: fixed-size cache of data pages.
* If page not in memory → reads it from disk using the **Storage Manager (SMGR)**.

```
Shared Buffers
 ├── Page 1 [employee heap]
 ├── Page 2 [employee index]
 └── ...
```

---

## 💿 6️⃣ Storage Manager (SMGR) & File System

* Each table is stored as one or more files in `base/<db_oid>/<relfilenode>`.
* SMGR performs actual **read/write syscalls** on these files.
* On a read:

  * SMGR asks the **OS page cache** for the block.
  * If not cached, the kernel reads it from disk (HDD or SSD).

---

## 🔐 7️⃣ Transaction Manager & MVCC

Once the tuple (row) is in memory, PostgreSQL performs **MVCC visibility check**:

| Field  | Meaning                             |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `xmin` | XID that inserted this tuple        |
| `xmax` | XID that deleted/updated this tuple |

It compares these against the transaction’s **snapshot** to decide if the row is visible (as explained earlier).

---

## 🧹 8️⃣ Vacuum, Free Space & Visibility Maps

* **Visibility Map (VM):** tells if all rows on a page are visible (for index-only scans).
* **Free Space Map (FSM):** tracks pages with room for new rows.
* **Vacuum** cleans old, invisible tuples later.

---

## 📨 9️⃣ Tuple to Output

Once the tuple passes visibility checks:

1. It is returned up the executor nodes.
2. The executor formats the tuple into a result row.
3. The backend encodes it (text/binary) via the **PostgreSQL FE/BE protocol**.
4. Sent back over the TCP socket to the client.
