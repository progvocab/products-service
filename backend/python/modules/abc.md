## **`abc` Module in Python (Abstract Base Classes)**  

The **`abc`** (Abstract Base Class) module in Python is used to define **abstract base classes (ABCs)**, which serve as blueprints for other classes.  

### **Why Use `abc`?**
1. **Enforce Method Implementation**: Ensure that subclasses implement specific methods.  
2. **Prevent Direct Instantiation**: ABCs **cannot be instantiated**; only subclasses that implement required methods can be used.  
3. **Promote Code Consistency**: Useful for designing frameworks, plugins, and API contracts.

## **1. Defining an Abstract Class**
An **abstract class** contains one or more **abstract methods** (methods without implementation).  

### **Example: Enforcing a `speak()` Method**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Define an abstract base class
class Animal(ABC):  
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        """Subclasses must implement this method"""
        pass

# Subclass that implements the abstract method
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Trying to instantiate Animal will raise an error
# animal = Animal()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class

# Valid usage
dog = Dog()
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```
- `@abstractmethod` ensures that **all subclasses must implement `speak()`**.
- Attempting to instantiate `Animal` directly **raises an error**.

---

## **2. Abstract Classes with Concrete Methods**
Abstract classes **can** include concrete methods (methods with implementations).

### **Example: Partial Implementation in Abstract Class**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    def start(self):
        return "Starting the vehicle..."

    @abstractmethod
    def fuel_type(self):
        """Subclasses must implement this method"""
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def fuel_type(self):
        return "Petrol or Diesel"

car = Car()
print(car.start())      # Output: Starting the vehicle...
print(car.fuel_type())  # Output: Petrol or Diesel
```
- `start()` is a **concrete method**, available to all subclasses.
- `fuel_type()` is an **abstract method** that must be implemented.

---

## **3. Using `ABCMeta` as a Metaclass (Old Method)**
Before Python 3.4, `ABCMeta` was explicitly used to define abstract classes.

```python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class Shape(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
```
This method is now **discouraged** in favor of inheriting from `ABC`.

---

## **4. Registering a Class as a Virtual Subclass**
You can use `ABC.register()` to declare a class as a **virtual subclass** without actual inheritance.

```python
from abc import ABC

class Flyable(ABC):
    pass

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        return "Flying in the sky"

Flyable.register(Airplane)  # Register Airplane as a subclass of Flyable

print(issubclass(Airplane, Flyable))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(Airplane(), Flyable))  # Output: True
```
- **`Airplane` does not inherit `Flyable`**, but it is still recognized as a subclass.

---

## **5. Benefits of Using `abc`**
✅ **Improves Code Maintainability**: Defines a clear contract for subclasses.  
✅ **Avoids Partial Implementations**: Ensures subclasses implement all required methods.  
✅ **Supports Multiple Inheritance**: Works well in complex OOP designs.

## **Summary**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `ABC` | Base class for defining abstract classes |
| `@abstractmethod` | Marks a method as required for subclasses |
| `ABCMeta` | Legacy metaclass for abstract classes |
| `register()` | Registers a virtual subclass without inheritance |
