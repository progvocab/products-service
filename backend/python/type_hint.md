Python type hints, introduced in Python 3.5, are annotations that specify the expected data types of variables, function arguments, and return values. They enhance code readability and facilitate static analysis for catching potential type errors before runtime. Type hints do not enforce type checking during execution but serve as valuable documentation and aid in code maintainability. 
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name

In this example, name: str indicates that the name argument should be a string, and -&gt; str specifies that the function returns a string. Type hints support various data types, including basic types like int, float, bool, and str, as well as more complex types like lists (list[int]), tuples (tuple[str, int]), and dictionaries (dict[str, float]). The typing module provides further tools for more advanced type hinting scenarios, such as generics and unions.
