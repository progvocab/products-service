 there are **whole families of problems** where greedy is not just a heuristic but the **provably optimal algorithm** for finding the *minimum number of operations*. Let me explain the idea, then give you classic examples üëá

# üîπ Why Greedy Can Be Optimal

Greedy works when:

1. **Local choice leads to global optimum**
   (a decision at step `i` never ‚Äúhurts‚Äù the future).
2. The problem has **optimal substructure**
   (the global solution is built from optimal solutions of subproblems).
3. The problem has the **greedy-choice property**
   (making the best local choice always leads to an optimal global solution).

When these conditions hold, greedy is not just fast ‚Äî it‚Äôs **mathematically guaranteed** to give the minimum.

| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Coin Change (Canonical systems, e.g. US coins)** | Minimum coins to make amount             | Choosing the largest possible coin doesn‚Äôt hurt future choices | Greedy coin selection           |
| **Interval Scheduling**                            | Select maximum non-overlapping intervals | Picking the earliest finishing job leaves the most room        | Sort by end time, pick greedily |
| **Activity Selection Problem**                     | Maximize number of tasks                 | Same as interval scheduling                                    | Greedy by finish time           |

| **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm (non-negative weights)**    | Shortest paths                           | Expanding smallest-distance node never hurts                   | Greedy priority queue           |
| **Fractional Knapsack**                            | Maximize profit for capacity             | Best ratio first is provably optimal                           | Greedy sort by value/weight     |
| **LeetCode 3191 (Binary Array Flips)**             | Minimum operations to make all 1         | You *must* flip when you see a 0 ‚Üí forced greedy choice        | Left-to-right greedy            |

# üîπ Greedy in **Minimum Operations** Problems

Some typical ‚Äúminimum operations‚Äù problems where greedy is optimal:

1. **Reducing a number to 1** (when allowed ops are divide by 2 if even, else subtract 1 ‚Üí greedy by dividing whenever possible gives minimum steps).
2. **Making an array all 1s** (like LeetCode 3191 ‚Äî flip when forced).
3. **Jump Game II (LeetCode 45)** ‚Üí minimum jumps to reach end ‚Üí greedy works by tracking farthest reach.
4. **Remove intervals to make array sorted** ‚Üí greedy by picking the longest increasing subsequence.

‚úÖ **Takeaway:**
There isn‚Äôt one universal ‚ÄúGreedy Algorithm‚Äù ‚Äî but a **class of problems** where greedy is mathematically the optimal strategy.
Whenever the problem has **greedy-choice property** + **optimal substructure**, greedy ‚Üí minimum operations.

Would you like me to take **one concrete problem (say Jump Game II)** and walk you through *why greedy beats DP* for minimum operations?
