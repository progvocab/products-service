 **Identity Federation** and **Identity Brokering** are often used interchangeably, but thereâ€™s a subtle difference. 

---

# **Identity Federation**

* **Definition**: The process of **linking a userâ€™s identity across multiple systems/domains** so the user can authenticate once and access services in different organizations.
* **Trust relationship**: Direct trust is established between the **Identity Provider (IdP)** and the **Service Provider (SP)**.
* **Standards used**: SAML, OAuth2, OpenID Connect.
* **Key Point**: Itâ€™s about **users having a single identity** across multiple domains.

âœ… Example:

* A university student logs into their university account and gets access to digital library services hosted by an external vendor (without a separate login).

---

# ðŸ”‘ **Identity Brokering**

* **Definition**: When an **intermediate IdP (broker)** sits between the client app and external IdPs, handling authentication delegation.
* **Trust relationship**: The client apps only trust the **broker IdP**, which in turn manages trust with multiple external IdPs.
* **Key Point**: Itâ€™s about the **middle layer mediating between multiple IdPs and your applications**.

âœ… Example:

* Keycloak acts as a **broker**.
* Your apps connect only to Keycloak.
* Keycloak allows login via Google, Facebook, LDAP, or another SAML IdP.
* Apps donâ€™t need to manage multiple IdP integrations.

# Quick Comparison Table

| Aspect                  | Identity Federation                                        | Identity Brokering                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it does**        | Links user identity across multiple domains                | Acts as a middle IdP between apps and external IdPs           |
| **Trust model**         | Direct trust: SP â†” IdP                                     | Indirect trust: App â†” Broker â†” External IdPs                  |
| **Complexity for apps** | Each app must integrate with external IdPs                 | Apps only integrate with broker IdP                           |
| **Example**             | SAML federation between a university and a digital library | Keycloak brokering login via Google and Azure AD              |
| **Best fit**            | Long-term trusted relationships between organizations      | Flexibility to connect multiple IdPs with minimal app changes |

 In simple words:

* **Federation = Linking identities across orgs directly**.
* **Brokering = Using a middle IdP to outsource the federation complexity**.

#  Identity Federation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Service Provider (SP)
    participant IdP as External Identity Provider

    User->>App: Access Application
    App->>IdP: Redirect to IdP (SAML/OIDC)
    User->>IdP: Enter Credentials
    IdP->>App: Assertion / Token (SAML/JWT)
    App->>User: Access Granted
```

âœ… Here, the **App (SP)** directly trusts the **IdP**.

---

#  Identity Brokering Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Application
    participant Broker as Broker IdP (Keycloak)
    participant Google as External IdP (Google/Azure/Okta)

    User->>App: Access Application
    App->>Broker: Redirect to Broker IdP
    Broker->>User: Show Login Options
    User->>Broker: Choose "Login with Google"
    Broker->>Google: Redirect to Google Login
    User->>Google: Enter Credentials
    Google->>Broker: Return Token
    Broker->>App: Issue Token (JWT)
    App->>User: Access Granted
```

Here, the **App only trusts the Broker (Keycloak)**, and the Broker manages **integration with external IdPs**.

---

# Key Takeaway

* **Federation**: Direct trust â†’ SP â†” IdP.
* **Brokering**: Indirect trust â†’ App â†” Broker â†” External IdPs.
