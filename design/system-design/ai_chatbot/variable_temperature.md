Good question 👍. Let’s connect this with embeddings and **GenAI chat system design** context.

The **temperature** parameter is part of **text generation (LLM inference)**, not embeddings.

* **Embeddings models** are deterministic (same input → same vector), no temperature.
* **LLMs (like GPT, LLaMA, Mistral)** use `temperature` to control randomness in token sampling.

---

## 🔹 What is Temperature in LLMs?

* `temperature = 0.0` → **deterministic**, safest answer, no randomness.
* `temperature = 0.7` → balance between creativity and coherence.
* `temperature = 1.0` → more randomness, diverse outputs.
* `temperature > 1.0` → very random, less factual, more creative.

---

## 🔹 How to Allow User-Defined Temperature

You need to **make temperature a parameter** that users can set when calling the model.

### 1. **If using OpenAI API**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def chat_with_model(prompt, temperature=0.7):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=temperature
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# User sets temperature
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=0.2))  # conservative
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=1.0))  # creative
```

---

### 2. **If using Hugging Face Transformers**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

def chat_with_model(prompt, temperature=0.7):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_length=100,
        temperature=temperature,
        do_sample=True
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Try different temperatures
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=0.3))
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=1.2))
```

---

### 3. **If building a Web App / Chatbot**

* Expose a **slider or dropdown** in the UI (0.0 → 2.0).
* Pass user input to backend.
* Backend forwards it to the model API call.

Example (pseudo API):

```json
POST /chat
{
  "prompt": "Tell me about AI",
  "temperature": 0.9
}
```

---

✅ **So the change required**:

* Add a `temperature` input parameter in your API/UI.
* Pass it through to the LLM inference call.
* Ensure the model’s `generate()` or `completion()` function uses it.

---

Would you like me to **draw a full flow diagram** of where the **temperature parameter fits in a GenAI + RAG system** (user → orchestrator → retriever → LLM → response)?


let’s tie **temperature** and **PDF/PMF** together in the context of language models.

---

## 1️⃣ Reminder: PDF vs PMF

* **PDF**: For continuous variables (heights, weights).
* **PMF**: For discrete variables (tokens in vocab).

👉 Language models use a **PMF over tokens** at each step.
But since the math generalizes, people often loosely call it a **distribution** (like a PDF).

---

## 2️⃣ Where Temperature Fits In

Before sampling a token, the model outputs **logits** (raw scores, real numbers).
We convert them into probabilities using **softmax**:

$$
P(t_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
$$

where $z_i$ is the logit for token $i$.

If we apply **temperature $T$**, the formula becomes:

$$
P_T(t_i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
$$

---

## 3️⃣ Effect of Temperature on the Distribution (PMF, analogous to PDF)

* **Low T (<1)** → probabilities get **sharper** (closer to a “spike” distribution).

  * The highest-probability token dominates.
  * Like a PDF with a tall narrow peak.
* **High T (>1)** → probabilities get **flatter** (more uniform).

  * Randomness increases, tail tokens get more chance.
  * Like a PDF that spreads out wide and flat.
* **T → 0** → becomes **greedy deterministic** (always picks max token).
* **T → ∞** → approaches **uniform distribution** (every token equally likely).

---

## 4️⃣ Analogy with PDF

If you think of the output distribution as a **probability landscape** (like a bell curve PDF):

* **Temperature scaling** stretches or squeezes that curve.

  * $T<1$: Curve gets **narrower and taller** (model is confident, less random).
  * $T>1$: Curve gets **wider and flatter** (model is uncertain, more random).

So temperature is essentially a **re-scaling of the distribution’s entropy**.

---

## 5️⃣ Connection to Top-p

* **Temperature** changes the *shape* of the PMF/PDF.
* **Top-p** cuts off the *tail* of low-probability values.

👉 Together, they define how much **creativity vs determinism** the model shows.

---

✅ **In short**:

* The model outputs a **PMF (like a discrete PDF)** over tokens.
* **Temperature scales the sharpness** of this distribution.
* **Lower T → spiky distribution** (less randomness).
* **Higher T → flatter distribution** (more randomness).

---

Would you like me to show you a **Python visualization** (plotting token probabilities with different temperatures) so you can **see how the PMF changes shape**?


Great question 🔥 — this goes right into the **mathematical foundation of language models and system design of sampling**.

---

# 🔹 What are *Logits*?

* In machine learning (esp. neural networks), **logits** are the **raw, unnormalized outputs** of the final layer of a model **before applying softmax**.
* For a language model, each logit corresponds to a vocabulary token.
* Example: If the vocabulary size = 50,000, the model outputs a **vector of 50,000 logits** at each step.

👉 They can be **positive, negative, or zero**, and don’t sum to 1.
👉 To turn them into probabilities, we apply the **softmax function**.

---

# 🔹 From Logits → Probabilities

The **softmax function** converts logits into a probability distribution:

$$
P(x_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
$$

* $z_i$ = logit for token $i$
* $P(x_i)$ = probability of token $i$

So, higher logits → higher probability after normalization.

---

# 🔹 Temperature in Sampling

**Temperature** is a scaling factor applied to logits **before softmax**:

$$
P(x_i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
$$

where:

* $T = 1.0$ → default (no scaling).
* $T < 1.0$ → makes distribution **sharper** (more deterministic).
* $T > 1.0$ → makes distribution **flatter** (more random).

---

# 🔹 Intuition

1. **Low Temperature (T → 0):**

   * Makes the softmax output **peakier**.
   * Model always picks the token with highest logit.
   * Good for deterministic text generation.
   * Risk: outputs become repetitive.

2. **High Temperature (T > 1):**

   * Makes softmax output more **uniform**.
   * Encourages more exploration / creativity.
   * Risk: incoherent or random responses.

---

# 🔹 Example Walkthrough

Suppose logits for 3 tokens are:

```
Token A → 2.0
Token B → 1.0
Token C → 0.1
```

### Case 1: Temperature = 1

$$
P(A) = \frac{e^2}{e^2 + e^1 + e^{0.1}} \approx 0.62
$$

$$
P(B) \approx 0.23,\; P(C) \approx 0.15
$$

→ Token A is most likely.

---

### Case 2: Temperature = 0.5 (sharper)

Logits scaled up: `[4.0, 2.0, 0.2]`

$$
P(A) \approx 0.88,\; P(B) \approx 0.12,\; P(C) \approx 0.004
$$

→ Model almost always picks A (deterministic).

---

### Case 3: Temperature = 2.0 (flatter)

Logits scaled down: `[1.0, 0.5, 0.05]`

$$
P(A) \approx 0.42,\; P(B) \approx 0.26,\; P(C) \approx 0.32
$$

→ More randomness, even C becomes viable.

---

# 🔹 Relationship Summary

* **Logits** = raw model scores.
* **Temperature** = scaling factor that **controls how sharply logits convert to probabilities**.
* **Low T** → exploit (focus on top tokens).
* **High T** → explore (spread probability).

---

✅ So in **system design of a language model inference layer**:

* Logits come from the model.
* Before applying softmax, they are divided by temperature.
* Then, depending on sampling strategy (top-k, nucleus/top-p, greedy), the final token is chosen.

---

Do you want me to also explain how **logits + temperature interact with Top-p (nucleus sampling)**? That’s the full picture of how models control randomness.
