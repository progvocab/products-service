In Oracle, **cursors** are pointers to the result set of a query. They allow row-by-row processing of query results. Oracle supports the following types of cursors:

---

## **1. Implicit Cursor**
- Automatically created by Oracle when a DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT INTO) statement is executed.
- No need for explicit declaration.

### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN
   UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 10;
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(SQL%ROWCOUNT || ' rows updated.');
END;
```
**Use Case:** Simple DML operations where individual row processing is not required.

---

## **2. Explicit Cursor**
- Declared explicitly to handle query result sets one row at a time.
- Provides better control over fetching and processing.

### **Example:**
```sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR emp_cursor IS SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
   v_id employees.employee_id%TYPE;
   v_name employees.first_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
   OPEN emp_cursor;
   LOOP
      FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_id, v_name;
      EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_id || ' - ' || v_name);
   END LOOP;
   CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
```
**Use Case:** When you need to process each row of a query individually.

---

## **3. Cursor FOR Loop**
- Simplifies explicit cursor by automatically handling `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE`.

### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN
   FOR emp_record IN (SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10)
   LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_record.employee_id || ' - ' || emp_record.first_name);
   END LOOP;
END;
```
**Use Case:** Preferred for readability and simplicity when no complex fetch logic is needed.

---

## **4. Parameterized Cursor**
- Accepts parameters to make cursor queries more dynamic.

### **Example:**
```sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR emp_cursor(p_dept_id NUMBER) IS
      SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = p_dept_id;
BEGIN
   FOR emp_record IN emp_cursor(10)
   LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_record.employee_id || ' - ' || emp_record.first_name);
   END LOOP;
END;
```
**Use Case:** When you need to reuse the same cursor logic for different inputs.

---

## **5. REF Cursor (Cursor Variable)**
- A pointer to a query result set. Can be passed between procedures/functions.
- **Strongly typed** or **Weakly typed**.

### **Example:**
```sql
DECLARE
   TYPE ref_cursor_type IS REF CURSOR;
   emp_ref_cursor ref_cursor_type;
   v_id employees.employee_id%TYPE;
   v_name employees.first_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
   OPEN emp_ref_cursor FOR SELECT employee_id, first_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
   LOOP
      FETCH emp_ref_cursor INTO v_id, v_name;
      EXIT WHEN emp_ref_cursor%NOTFOUND;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_id || ' - ' || v_name);
   END LOOP;
   CLOSE emp_ref_cursor;
END;
```
**Use Case:** Useful in dynamic SQL, and for returning query results from stored procedures/functions.

Oracle's implementation of cursors **extends the ANSI SQL standards** by providing more flexibility and procedural capabilities through **PL/SQL**. Here's a breakdown of how Oracle cursors differ from ANSI SQL:

---

### **1. PL/SQL-Specific Enhancements**

| Feature | Oracle Cursor | ANSI SQL |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Explicit Cursors** | Fully supported in PL/SQL with `DECLARE`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, `CLOSE`. | Not part of standard SQL; only found in procedural extensions like T-SQL or PL/pgSQL. |
| **Cursor FOR Loop** | Oracle simplifies iteration with implicit open/fetch/close using `FOR IN`. | Not defined in ANSI SQL. Requires manual handling. |
| **Parameterized Cursors** | Oracle supports passing parameters to cursors. | Not in ANSI SQL. |
| **REF Cursors (Cursor Variables)** | Oracle supports both strongly and weakly typed cursor variables (REF CURSOR). | ANSI SQL has no such concept. |
| **%ROWTYPE and %TYPE Attributes** | Oracle allows dynamic variable typing using table column/row definitions. | Not part of ANSI SQL. |

---

### **2. Implicit Cursor Handling**

- Oracle implicitly creates a cursor (`SQL`) for every DML or SELECT INTO operation.
- You can reference attributes like:
  - `SQL%ROWCOUNT`
  - `SQL%FOUND`
  - `SQL%NOTFOUND`

> **ANSI SQL** doesn't define a concept of implicit cursors or expose cursor metadata via variables.

---

### **3. Cursor Attributes**

- Oracle provides cursor attributes:
  - `%ISOPEN`, `%FOUND`, `%NOTFOUND`, `%ROWCOUNT`
- ANSI SQL has no concept of these attributes â€” procedural logic must handle states explicitly.

---

### **4. Cursor Sharing and Scope**

- **Oracle allows cursor sharing** with `REF CURSOR`, and passing them between procedures.
- **ANSI SQL** lacks built-in support for passing cursors as parameters or variables between code blocks.

---

### **Summary**

While ANSI SQL defines a basic `CURSOR` construct (mainly in embedded SQL for C/C++ like **SQL/CLI** or **SQL/PSM**), **Oracle goes far beyond** with its PL/SQL procedural capabilities, making it a more powerful and developer-friendly cursor system.
