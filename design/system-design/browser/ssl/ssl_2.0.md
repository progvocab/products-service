Perfect — here’s the **SSL 2.0 handshake flow**, written in the same concise “message exchange” style you used 👇

### 🔐 **SSL 2.0 Handshake Flow (Simplified)**

**Client → Server:**
👉 **ClientHello**

* Proposes cipher suites
* Sends random nonce
* Sends session ID (if resuming)

**Server → Client:**
👉 **ServerHello**

* Chooses cipher suite
* Sends random nonce
* Sends its digital certificate (optional depending on cipher)

**Client → Server:**
👉 **ClientMasterKey**

* Sends a **master key** (often encrypted only if server certificate was provided — otherwise sometimes sent *in plaintext*, a major weakness)

**Client → Server:**
👉 **ClientFinished**

* Indicates end of client messages before encryption begins

**Server → Client:**
👉 **ServerVerify / ServerFinished**

* Verifies the master key
* Both sides derive the session keys

**Both:**
👉 **Switch to Encrypted Mode**

* Subsequent data (application traffic) is encrypted using the negotiated session keys

### ⚠️ **Major Weaknesses in SSL 2.0**

* **No protection for handshake messages** → vulnerable to modification attacks
* **Weak MAC and key derivation**
* **Client authentication optional and insecure**
* **Cleartext master key in some ciphers**
* **No negotiation rollback protection** (could force downgrade to weak cipher)

🛑 **Status:**
SSL 2.0 was officially deprecated in **1996** and **prohibited by RFC 6176** (2011).
Modern systems use **TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3**, which fix these weaknesses.

Would you like me to show the **TLS 1.2 handshake flow** in the *same concise arrow format* next, so you can compare how it evolved from SSL 2.0?
