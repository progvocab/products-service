**hooks** are a concept from neural networks (especially PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) that let you **intercept and interact with transformations inside layers**. Think of them as "observers" or "breakpoints" inside the computational graph.

# üîπ What is a Hook?

A **hook** is a function you can attach to a **layer, tensor, or transformation** so that it is executed **during forward or backward pass**.

It‚Äôs like saying:

> "Whenever this layer does a forward (transformation of input) or backward (gradient calculation), also run my custom code."

---

# üîπ Types of Hooks

1. **Forward Hooks**

   * Triggered during **forward pass** after the layer computes its output.
   * Useful for:

     * Inspecting activations (outputs of layers).
     * Modifying outputs (e.g., applying custom transformation).
     * Visualizing intermediate features (CNN filters, attention maps).

2. **Backward Hooks**

   * Triggered during **backpropagation** when gradients flow through the layer.
   * Useful for:

     * Debugging exploding/vanishing gradients.
     * Gradient clipping or modification.
     * Implementing custom regularization.

---

# üîπ Hooks in the Context of ANN Transformations

In **ANN system design**, each layer is a transformation:

$$
z = T(x) = f(Wx+b)
$$

* A **forward hook** lets you capture or modify $z$ (activation).
* A **backward hook** lets you capture or modify $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}$ (gradient of loss wrt output).

# üîπ PyTorch Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Simple ANN layer
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return F.relu(self.fc1(x))

model = Net()

# Define hook
def forward_hook(module, input, output):
    print(f"Inside {module.__class__.__name__}")
    print(f"Input shape: {input[0].shape}")
    print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

# Attach hook to layer
hook_handle = model.fc1.register_forward_hook(forward_hook)

# Run forward pass
x = torch.randn(2, 10)
y = model(x)

hook_handle.remove()
```

üìå Output:

```
Inside Linear
Input shape: torch.Size([2, 10])
Output shape: torch.Size([2, 5])
```

---

# üîπ Practical Uses of Hooks

* **Debugging:** Inspect inputs/outputs of transformations in deep networks.
* **Visualization:** Extract activations to visualize CNN feature maps.
* **Custom Behavior:** Apply transformations not originally in the model (e.g., attention masks, adversarial perturbations).
* **Gradient Surgery:** Modify gradients during training for advanced research.

---

# üîπ Analogy

Imagine each ANN layer is a **factory machine**:

* Input goes in ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí output.
* A **hook** is like placing a **sensor or control lever** on that machine.

  * Forward hook ‚Üí measure or tweak the product right after it‚Äôs made.
  * Backward hook ‚Üí inspect or adjust the error signals during quality control.

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:
A **hook** in ANN is a **custom function attached to a transformation/layer** that executes during forward or backward pass. It‚Äôs powerful for **debugging, visualization, custom transformations, and research experiments**.

Would you like me to also explain **how hooks are used in Transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT) to inspect attention heads and logits**?


Got it üëç ‚Äî let me give you **clear Python code examples** of using **hooks** in ANN with PyTorch. I‚Äôll show both **forward hooks** (to inspect activations) and **backward hooks** (to inspect gradients).

---

## üîπ 1. Forward Hook Example (inspect activations)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Simple ANN model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = Net()

# Hook function to capture activations
def forward_hook(module, input, output):
    print(f"[Forward Hook] Layer: {module.__class__.__name__}")
    print(f"Input shape: {input[0].shape}")
    print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}\n")

# Attach hook to fc1 layer
hook_handle = model.fc1.register_forward_hook(forward_hook)

# Run forward pass
x = torch.randn(3, 10)
y = model(x)

hook_handle.remove()  # cleanup
```

‚úÖ Output (example):

```
[Forward Hook] Layer: Linear
Input shape: torch.Size([3, 10])
Output shape: torch.Size([3, 5])
```

---

## üîπ 2. Backward Hook Example (inspect gradients)

```python
# Hook function to capture gradients
def backward_hook(module, grad_input, grad_output):
    print(f"[Backward Hook] Layer: {module.__class__.__name__}")
    print(f"Grad input: {grad_input}")
    print(f"Grad output: {grad_output}\n")

# Attach hook to fc2 layer
hook_handle = model.fc2.register_backward_hook(backward_hook)

# Run forward + backward pass
x = torch.randn(3, 10)
y = model(x)

loss = y.sum()   # simple loss
loss.backward()  # triggers backward hooks

hook_handle.remove()
```

‚úÖ Output (example):

```
[Backward Hook] Layer: Linear
Grad input: (tensor(...), tensor(...))
Grad output: (tensor(...),)
```

---

## üîπ 3. Collect Activations in Dictionary (useful in practice)

```python
activations = {}

def save_activation(name):
    def hook(module, input, output):
        activations[name] = output.detach()
    return hook

# Attach hooks to multiple layers
model.fc1.register_forward_hook(save_activation("fc1"))
model.fc2.register_forward_hook(save_activation("fc2"))

# Run forward pass
x = torch.randn(1, 10)
y = model(x)

print("Saved activations:")
for layer, act in activations.items():
    print(layer, act.shape)
```

‚úÖ Example Output:

```
Saved activations:
fc1 torch.Size([1, 5])
fc2 torch.Size([1, 2])
```

---

üîë **Summary**:

* `register_forward_hook` ‚Üí capture **activations**.
* `register_backward_hook` ‚Üí capture **gradients**.
* Useful for debugging, visualization, or modifying training behavior.

Do you want me to also show how hooks are used in **Transformers (like GPT/BERT)** to inspect **attention weights and logits**?
