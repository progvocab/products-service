Good question üëç. Let‚Äôs connect this with embeddings and **GenAI chat system design** context.

The **temperature** parameter is part of **text generation (LLM inference)**, not embeddings.

* **Embeddings models** are deterministic (same input ‚Üí same vector), no temperature.
* **LLMs (like GPT, LLaMA, Mistral)** use `temperature` to control randomness in token sampling.

---

## üîπ What is Temperature in LLMs?

* `temperature = 0.0` ‚Üí **deterministic**, safest answer, no randomness.
* `temperature = 0.7` ‚Üí balance between creativity and coherence.
* `temperature = 1.0` ‚Üí more randomness, diverse outputs.
* `temperature > 1.0` ‚Üí very random, less factual, more creative.

---

## üîπ How to Allow User-Defined Temperature

You need to **make temperature a parameter** that users can set when calling the model.

### 1. **If using OpenAI API**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def chat_with_model(prompt, temperature=0.7):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=temperature
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# User sets temperature
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=0.2))  # conservative
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=1.0))  # creative
```

---

### 2. **If using Hugging Face Transformers**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

def chat_with_model(prompt, temperature=0.7):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_length=100,
        temperature=temperature,
        do_sample=True
    )
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Try different temperatures
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=0.3))
print(chat_with_model("Write a poem about the moon", temperature=1.2))
```

---

### 3. **If building a Web App / Chatbot**

* Expose a **slider or dropdown** in the UI (0.0 ‚Üí 2.0).
* Pass user input to backend.
* Backend forwards it to the model API call.

Example (pseudo API):

```json
POST /chat
{
  "prompt": "Tell me about AI",
  "temperature": 0.9
}
```

---

‚úÖ **So the change required**:

* Add a `temperature` input parameter in your API/UI.
* Pass it through to the LLM inference call.
* Ensure the model‚Äôs `generate()` or `completion()` function uses it.

---

Would you like me to **draw a full flow diagram** of where the **temperature parameter fits in a GenAI + RAG system** (user ‚Üí orchestrator ‚Üí retriever ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí response)?


let‚Äôs tie **temperature** and **PDF/PMF** together in the context of language models.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Reminder: PDF vs PMF

* **PDF**: For continuous variables (heights, weights).
* **PMF**: For discrete variables (tokens in vocab).

üëâ Language models use a **PMF over tokens** at each step.
But since the math generalizes, people often loosely call it a **distribution** (like a PDF).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Where Temperature Fits In

Before sampling a token, the model outputs **logits** (raw scores, real numbers).
We convert them into probabilities using **softmax**:

$$
P(t_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
$$

where $z_i$ is the logit for token $i$.

If we apply **temperature $T$**, the formula becomes:

$$
P_T(t_i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
$$

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Effect of Temperature on the Distribution (PMF, analogous to PDF)

* **Low T (<1)** ‚Üí probabilities get **sharper** (closer to a ‚Äúspike‚Äù distribution).

  * The highest-probability token dominates.
  * Like a PDF with a tall narrow peak.
* **High T (>1)** ‚Üí probabilities get **flatter** (more uniform).

  * Randomness increases, tail tokens get more chance.
  * Like a PDF that spreads out wide and flat.
* **T ‚Üí 0** ‚Üí becomes **greedy deterministic** (always picks max token).
* **T ‚Üí ‚àû** ‚Üí approaches **uniform distribution** (every token equally likely).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analogy with PDF

If you think of the output distribution as a **probability landscape** (like a bell curve PDF):

* **Temperature scaling** stretches or squeezes that curve.

  * $T<1$: Curve gets **narrower and taller** (model is confident, less random).
  * $T>1$: Curve gets **wider and flatter** (model is uncertain, more random).

So temperature is essentially a **re-scaling of the distribution‚Äôs entropy**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Connection to Top-p

* **Temperature** changes the *shape* of the PMF/PDF.
* **Top-p** cuts off the *tail* of low-probability values.

üëâ Together, they define how much **creativity vs determinism** the model shows.

---

‚úÖ **In short**:

* The model outputs a **PMF (like a discrete PDF)** over tokens.
* **Temperature scales the sharpness** of this distribution.
* **Lower T ‚Üí spiky distribution** (less randomness).
* **Higher T ‚Üí flatter distribution** (more randomness).

---

Would you like me to show you a **Python visualization** (plotting token probabilities with different temperatures) so you can **see how the PMF changes shape**?


Great question üî• ‚Äî this goes right into the **mathematical foundation of language models and system design of sampling**.

---

# üîπ What are *Logits*?

* In machine learning (esp. neural networks), **logits** are the **raw, unnormalized outputs** of the final layer of a model **before applying softmax**.
* For a language model, each logit corresponds to a vocabulary token.
* Example: If the vocabulary size = 50,000, the model outputs a **vector of 50,000 logits** at each step.

üëâ They can be **positive, negative, or zero**, and don‚Äôt sum to 1.
üëâ To turn them into probabilities, we apply the **softmax function**.

---

# üîπ From Logits ‚Üí Probabilities

The **softmax function** converts logits into a probability distribution:

$$
P(x_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
$$

* $z_i$ = logit for token $i$
* $P(x_i)$ = probability of token $i$

So, higher logits ‚Üí higher probability after normalization.

---

# üîπ Temperature in Sampling

**Temperature** is a scaling factor applied to logits **before softmax**:

$$
P(x_i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
$$

where:

* $T = 1.0$ ‚Üí default (no scaling).
* $T < 1.0$ ‚Üí makes distribution **sharper** (more deterministic).
* $T > 1.0$ ‚Üí makes distribution **flatter** (more random).

---

# üîπ Intuition

1. **Low Temperature (T ‚Üí 0):**

   * Makes the softmax output **peakier**.
   * Model always picks the token with highest logit.
   * Good for deterministic text generation.
   * Risk: outputs become repetitive.

2. **High Temperature (T > 1):**

   * Makes softmax output more **uniform**.
   * Encourages more exploration / creativity.
   * Risk: incoherent or random responses.

---

# üîπ Example Walkthrough

Suppose logits for 3 tokens are:

```
Token A ‚Üí 2.0
Token B ‚Üí 1.0
Token C ‚Üí 0.1
```

### Case 1: Temperature = 1

$$
P(A) = \frac{e^2}{e^2 + e^1 + e^{0.1}} \approx 0.62
$$

$$
P(B) \approx 0.23,\; P(C) \approx 0.15
$$

‚Üí Token A is most likely.

---

### Case 2: Temperature = 0.5 (sharper)

Logits scaled up: `[4.0, 2.0, 0.2]`

$$
P(A) \approx 0.88,\; P(B) \approx 0.12,\; P(C) \approx 0.004
$$

‚Üí Model almost always picks A (deterministic).

---

### Case 3: Temperature = 2.0 (flatter)

Logits scaled down: `[1.0, 0.5, 0.05]`

$$
P(A) \approx 0.42,\; P(B) \approx 0.26,\; P(C) \approx 0.32
$$

‚Üí More randomness, even C becomes viable.

---

# üîπ Relationship Summary

* **Logits** = raw model scores.
* **Temperature** = scaling factor that **controls how sharply logits convert to probabilities**.
* **Low T** ‚Üí exploit (focus on top tokens).
* **High T** ‚Üí explore (spread probability).

---

‚úÖ So in **system design of a language model inference layer**:

* Logits come from the model.
* Before applying softmax, they are divided by temperature.
* Then, depending on sampling strategy (top-k, nucleus/top-p, greedy), the final token is chosen.

---

Do you want me to also explain how **logits + temperature interact with Top-p (nucleus sampling)**? That‚Äôs the full picture of how models control randomness.

Nice follow-up üî• ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step by step into **class log probabilities**, how they‚Äôre computed, and why we use them.

---

# üîπ What are Class Log Probabilities?

* In classification (e.g., predicting digit from MNIST, or next token in language modeling), the model outputs **logits** (raw scores).
* We convert logits ‚Üí **probabilities** using softmax.
* But instead of probabilities, we often work with **log-probabilities**:

$$
\log P(y = c \mid x) = \log \left( \frac{e^{z_c}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}} \right)
$$

where:

* $z_c$ = logit for class $c$
* denominator = sum of exponentials of all logits

---

# üîπ Why use Log Probabilities?

1. **Numerical Stability**

   * Probabilities can be very small (e.g., $10^{-30}$).
   * Logs prevent underflow.
   * Example: multiplying probabilities (e.g., sequence models) becomes adding logs.

2. **Efficient Loss Computation**

   * Cross-entropy loss is naturally defined using log probabilities:

   $$
   L = -\log P(y_\text{true} \mid x)
   $$

3. **Interpretability in Language Models**

   * When decoding, we track **log-likelihood of sequences**.
   * A higher log probability (closer to 0) = more likely sequence.

---

# üîπ Example (3-class problem)

Suppose logits = `[2.0, 1.0, 0.1]`

### Step 1: Convert to probabilities

$$
P(i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}}
$$

Denominator = $e^2 + e^1 + e^{0.1} \approx 7.389 + 2.718 + 1.105 = 11.212$

$$
P(1) = 7.389 / 11.212 \approx 0.66
$$

$$
P(2) = 2.718 / 11.212 \approx 0.24
$$

$$
P(3) = 1.105 / 11.212 \approx 0.10
$$

### Step 2: Take log

$$
\log P(1) \approx -0.41
$$

$$
\log P(2) \approx -1.43
$$

$$
\log P(3) \approx -2.30
$$

üëâ These are **class log probabilities**.

---

# üîπ In Language Models

For next-token prediction:

* Model outputs logits for entire vocabulary (say 50,000 words).
* Convert to **log probs**.
* Sampling/beam search uses these values:

  * Greedy decoding ‚Üí pick token with highest log prob.
  * Beam search ‚Üí track sum of log probs across sequence.

Example sequence scoring:

```
P("the") = 0.5 ‚Üí log = -0.69
P("cat") = 0.2 ‚Üí log = -1.60
Total log prob("the cat") = -0.69 + (-1.60) = -2.29
```

---

# üîπ Relationship with Temperature

When temperature $T$ is applied, logits are scaled:

$$
P(c) = \frac{e^{z_c / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
$$

Then:

$$
\log P(c) = \frac{z_c}{T} - \log \sum_j e^{z_j / T}
$$

So:

* **Lower T (<1)** ‚Üí spreads log probabilities farther apart (makes one class dominate).
* **Higher T (>1)** ‚Üí log probs get closer (distribution more uniform).

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* **Class log probabilities** = log of softmaxed logits.
* Used for **stability, efficient loss computation, and sequence scoring**.
* In LMs, they are the backbone of sampling strategies (greedy, beam search, top-k, nucleus).
* Temperature directly modifies them by scaling logits before softmax.
* Logits are raw, unnormalized scores from a neural network's final layer, while softmax is an activation function that converts these logits into probabilities that sum to 1. The softmax function uses the exponential of each logit, then normalizes by the sum of all exponentials to produce a probability distribution, which is useful for multi-class classification tasks. 

---

Would you like me to also show you a **Python/PyTorch example** where we compute logits ‚Üí probs ‚Üí log probs, and how temperature changes them?
