In Apache Airflow, **sensors** are a special type of operator that waits for a specific condition to be met before proceeding with the workflow. Sensors are useful for dependencies that depend on external systems, such as waiting for a file to be available or a database entry to be created.

### **Types of Sensors in Airflow**

#### **1. Time-based Sensors**
- **`TimeDeltaSensor`** â€“ Waits for a specified amount of time.
- **`DateTimeSensor`** â€“ Waits until a specific date and time.

#### **2. File and Directory Sensors**
- **`FileSensor`** â€“ Waits for a file to appear in a specified path.
- **`DirSensor`** â€“ Waits for a directory to contain a file (checks if a directory is not empty).

#### **3. Database Sensors**
- **`SqlSensor`** â€“ Waits for a SQL query to return a result.
- **`PostgresSensor`** â€“ Waits for a query result in a PostgreSQL database.
- **`MySqlSensor`** â€“ Waits for a query result in a MySQL database.

#### **4. External System Sensors**
- **`ExternalTaskSensor`** â€“ Waits for another Airflow task in a different DAG to complete.
- **`HivePartitionSensor`** â€“ Waits for a partition to appear in a Hive table.
- **`HdfsSensor`** â€“ Waits for a file or folder to appear in HDFS.

#### **5. Cloud Service Sensors**
- **`S3KeySensor`** â€“ Waits for a file to be available in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- **`GCSObjectExistenceSensor`** â€“ Waits for a file to appear in Google Cloud Storage.
- **`GCSObjectUpdateSensor`** â€“ Waits for an update to an existing file in Google Cloud Storage.
- **`GoogleBigQueryTableSensor`** â€“ Waits for a BigQuery table to exist.

#### **6. API and Messaging Sensors**
- **`HttpSensor`** â€“ Waits for an HTTP endpoint to return a valid response.
- **`NamedHivePartitionSensor`** â€“ Waits for a specific partition in a Hive table.
- **`RedisPubSubSensor`** â€“ Waits for a message on a Redis Pub/Sub channel.

#### **7. Custom Sensors**
If the built-in sensors do not meet your requirements, you can create a **custom sensor** by subclassing `BaseSensorOperator` and implementing the `poke` method.
