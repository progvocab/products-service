# üåü Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

The **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** based on **Bayes‚Äô Theorem**. It is called *na√Øve* because it assumes that **all features are independent given the class label** ‚Äî which is rarely true in reality, but still works surprisingly well in many cases.

---

## 1. **Bayes‚Äô Theorem Reminder**

$$
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}
$$

Where:

* $C$ = Class (e.g., spam or not spam)
* $X = (x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n)$ = Feature vector (e.g., words in an email)
* $P(C|X)$ = Posterior probability of class given features

---

## 2. **Na√Øve Independence Assumption**

Instead of computing $P(X|C)$ directly (which is complex), Na√Øve Bayes assumes features are independent:

$$
P(X|C) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C)
$$

Thus:

$$
P(C|X) \propto P(C) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | C)
$$

We pick the class $C$ that maximizes this probability.

## 3. **Types of Na√Øve Bayes**

Different variants exist depending on how we model $P(x_i|C)$:

1. **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes**

   * Used for text classification (counts of words).

2. **Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes**

   * Features are binary (word present/absent).

3. **Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes**

   * For continuous features, assumes they follow a normal distribution.

## 4. **Example: Spam Filtering**

Suppose we want to classify emails as **Spam (S)** or **Not Spam (NS)**.

Email: `"Win money now"`
Features: {‚Äúwin‚Äù, ‚Äúmoney‚Äù, ‚Äúnow‚Äù}

We compute:

$$
P(S | \text{email}) \propto P(S) \cdot P(\text{win}|S) \cdot P(\text{money}|S) \cdot P(\text{now}|S)
$$

$$
P(NS | \text{email}) \propto P(NS) \cdot P(\text{win}|NS) \cdot P(\text{money}|NS) \cdot P(\text{now}|NS)
$$

The higher probability determines classification.

## 5. **Applications in ML**

* **Spam detection** (emails: spam vs not spam)
* **Sentiment analysis** (positive vs negative reviews)
* **Medical diagnosis** (disease vs no disease)
* **Text classification** (news categorization, topic detection)

---

## 6. **Advantages**

* Very fast, works well on large datasets.
* Performs surprisingly well even with independence assumption.
* Easy to implement, interpretable.

---

## 7. **Disadvantages**

* Independence assumption is often unrealistic.
* Struggles with correlated features.
* Requires large enough data for reliable probability estimates.

---

‚úÖ **In summary:** Na√Øve Bayes is a simple yet powerful classifier that uses probability and independence assumptions to classify data, especially effective in **text and document classification** tasks.

Would you like me to **show you a Python implementation with a real dataset (like spam detection or sentiment analysis)** so you can see it in action?
