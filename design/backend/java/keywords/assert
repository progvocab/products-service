Great question 👍

In **Java**, the `assert` keyword is used for **assertions** — a way to test assumptions in your code at runtime.

---

### ✅ Syntax

```java
assert condition;
assert condition : message;
```

* `condition` → a boolean expression (must evaluate to `true` or `false`).
* `message` → an optional expression whose value is used in the error if the assertion fails.

---

### ✅ Example

```java
public class AssertExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 15;

        // Simple assertion
        assert age >= 18 : "Age must be at least 18, but found " + age;

        System.out.println("Program continues if assertion passes.");
    }
}
```

If `age < 18`, the program throws:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: Age must be at least 18, but found 15
```

---

### ✅ How to Enable Assertions

Assertions are **disabled by default** in Java runtime.
You must enable them with the `-ea` (or `-enableassertions`) flag:

```bash
java -ea AssertExample
```

Without `-ea`, assertions are ignored (like comments).

---

### ✅ When to Use `assert`

* **Development and testing** — to catch programming mistakes early.
* **Preconditions and postconditions** — to validate assumptions.
* **Debugging** — instead of adding temporary `System.out.println`.

---

### ❌ When NOT to Use

* Don’t use `assert` for **normal error handling** (e.g., user input validation, file not found).
* Assertions may be **turned off** in production, so they shouldn’t replace real checks.

---

✅ **In short:**
`assert` in Java is a **debugging aid** to verify assumptions during development. If the condition is false and assertions are enabled, it throws an `AssertionError`.

---

Would you like me to also show you how **JUnit assertions (like `assertEquals`)** differ from Java’s built-in `assert`?


Good question 👍

In **Java**, assertions (`assert`) are **off by default** at runtime.
That means if you just run your app normally:

```bash
java MyApp
```

👉 all `assert` statements are ignored (no runtime cost, no checks).

---

### 🔧 Controlling Assertions

* **Enable assertions (for dev/test):**

  ```bash
  java -ea MyApp
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  java -enableassertions MyApp
  ```

* **Disable assertions (for prod):**

  ```bash
  java -da MyApp
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  java -disableassertions MyApp
  ```

Since the **default** is disabled, you typically don’t need to do anything special in production.

---

### 🔍 Granular Control

You can enable/disable assertions per **package** or **class**:

* Enable only for a package:

  ```bash
  java -ea:com.mycompany... MyApp
  ```

* Disable for a specific class:

  ```bash
  java -da:com.mycompany.utils.Validator MyApp
  ```

* Disable system assertions (like in core Java classes):

  ```bash
  java -dsa MyApp
  ```

---

### ✅ Best Practice

* **Development / Testing:** run with `-ea` so your assertions catch bugs.
* **Production:** run without `-ea` (the default) so assertions are ignored, ensuring no performance penalty.

Would you like me to also show you how **JUnit/TestNG assertions** behave differently (since they’re always active, even in production tests)?
