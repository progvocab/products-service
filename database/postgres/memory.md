Excellent ‚Äî this goes straight to the **heart of PostgreSQL internals** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

When you say **‚Äúcomponents which live in memory‚Äù**, you‚Äôre talking about **PostgreSQL‚Äôs in-memory data structures and caches** that sit **between the disk (storage) and queries (execution engine)**.

Let‚Äôs break them down ‚Äî starting from the high-level architecture, and then detail each **in-memory component** üëá

---

## üß† 1. High-level Overview ‚Äî PostgreSQL Memory Architecture

When PostgreSQL starts, it allocates **shared** and **local** memory areas:

```
+------------------------------------------------+
| PostgreSQL Memory                              |
|                                                |
|  +-------------------+   +------------------+  |
|  | Shared Memory     |   | Local Memory     |  |
|  | (visible to all   |   | (per connection) |  |
|  |   backends)       |   |                  |  |
|  +-------------------+   +------------------+  |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

## üß© 2. Shared Memory (shared by all backend processes)

This is where the main **in-memory coordination and caching** happens.

| Component                                  | Description                                                          | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Buffers**                         | Main in-memory cache for table and index pages                       | Holds frequently accessed data pages from disk (like OS page cache but inside PostgreSQL) |
| **WAL Buffers**                            | Buffer area for WAL (Write-Ahead Log) entries before writing to disk | Ensures durable logging before commit                                                     |
| **Commit Log (CLOG)**                      | Tracks transaction commit/abort status                               | Used by MVCC visibility checks                                                            |
| **Lock Table**                             | In-memory structure for locks                                        | Manages concurrency control                                                               |
| **Buffer Descriptor Table**                | Metadata about each shared buffer                                    | Keeps track of which page each buffer holds                                               |
| **Replication Slots / Stats Collector**    | Track replication and stats                                          | Used for logical/physical replication                                                     |
| **Background Writer / Checkpointer State** | In-memory queue of dirty buffers                                     | Helps flushing dirty pages to disk periodically                                           |

---

### üß± **Shared Buffers (Core in-memory cache)**

Each **table or index page** that‚Äôs read from disk goes into **shared buffers**.
Default: `shared_buffers = 128MB` (can be increased, e.g. 25% of RAM).

**Structure:**

```
+------------------------+
| Shared Buffers (N pages)|
+------------------------+
| [0] heap page (table1) |
| [1] index page         |
| [2] heap page (table2) |
| ...                    |
+------------------------+
```

When a query reads data:

1. Check if the page is in shared buffers.
2. If yes ‚Üí serve directly from memory (cache hit).
3. If not ‚Üí fetch from disk, store in shared buffer (cache miss).

---

### ü™µ **WAL Buffers**

* Small in-memory buffer (default 16MB).
* Temporarily holds WAL records before writing to disk.
* Helps **batch writes** and improve durability efficiency.

---

### üîí **Lock Tables & ProcArray**

* PostgreSQL uses lightweight locks (LWLocks) and heavyweight locks (LockMgr) to synchronize access.
* Stored in shared memory.
* Each backend process registers in **ProcArray** to track active transactions.

---

## üßç 3. Local Memory (per backend connection)

Each client connection has its own private memory structures (not shared).

| Component                        | Description                               | Purpose                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Work_mem**                     | Memory for sorting, hashing, aggregations | Used in `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, joins |
| **Maintenance_work_mem**         | Memory for maintenance tasks              | Used in `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`      |
| **Temp Buffers**                 | For temporary tables                      | Session-local caching                 |
| **Executor State (ExprContext)** | Per-query memory for execution            | Holds tuples during execution         |
| **Portal Context**               | Memory context for a running query/portal | Used in cursor-based queries          |
| **Session Memory**               | Connection-related context                | Manages session-level state and GUCs  |

---

## üîÅ 4. Interaction Between Memory and Disk

When a query inserts or reads a row:

```
          +----------------------------------+
          |            PostgreSQL            |
          +----------------------------------+
                         ‚îÇ
         ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
         ‚ñº                                ‚ñº
   Shared Buffers                   WAL Buffers
         ‚îÇ                                ‚îÇ
         ‚ñº                                ‚ñº
   Data Files (Heap/Index)          WAL Segment Files
```

* **Insert / Update** ‚Üí changes recorded in shared buffer + WAL buffer.
* **Commit** ‚Üí WAL flushed to disk (fsync).
* **Checkpointer / Background Writer** ‚Üí periodically flush dirty shared buffers to data files.
