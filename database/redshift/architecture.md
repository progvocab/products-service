## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Architectural Differences**  

### **üìå 1. Storage and Data Format**  

- **Amazon Redshift:**  
  - Uses **columnar storage** for efficiency in analytical queries.  
  - Stores data in **S3** for backup and recovery.  
  - Uses **Zone Maps** to skip unnecessary blocks during queries.  

- **DuckDB:**  
  - Uses an **embedded** format, storing data in a single `.duckdb` file.  
  - Works directly with **Parquet** without needing explicit loading.  
  - In-memory optimized, leading to faster analytics for local datasets.  

- **ClickHouse:**  
  - Uses **MergeTree** table engines for columnar storage.  
  - Supports **compressed data storage**, reducing disk space.  
  - Allows **real-time inserts and queries**, optimized for log-based data.

### **üìå 2. Query Execution Model**  

- **Amazon Redshift:**  
  - **Distributed MPP Engine:** Splits queries across multiple compute nodes.  
  - Uses **compiled query execution** for performance.  
  - Requires **VACUUM and ANALYZE** for performance tuning.  

- **DuckDB:**  
  - **Vectorized Execution:** Processes data in **batches** rather than row-by-row.  
  - Designed for **interactive analytics** on local data.  
  - **Does not require indexes** due to its efficient scan performance.  

- **ClickHouse:**  
  - **Vectorized Execution with JIT Compilation.**  
  - Supports **distributed query execution** over multiple nodes.  
  - Can **ingest high-velocity data streams** efficiently.
