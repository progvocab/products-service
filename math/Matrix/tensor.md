Almost right ✅ — but let’s refine it a bit because **tensor** isn’t always 4D.

---

## **1. Vector**

* **Definition**: 1D array of numbers.
* Shape: `(n,)` (or sometimes `(1, n)` / `(n, 1)` if forced into 2D).
* Example:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  v = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # shape = (3,)
  ```

---

## **2. Matrix**

* **Definition**: 2D array (rows × columns).
* Shape: `(m, n)`
* Example:

  ```python
  M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])   # shape = (2, 3)
  ```

---

## **3. Tensor**

* **Definition**: Generalization of vectors & matrices to **n dimensions** (n ≥ 3).
* Shape: Can be **3D, 4D, 5D...** depending on the problem.
* Example:

  * **3D tensor** → batch of word embeddings `(batch, sequence_length, embedding_dim)`
  * **4D tensor** → batch of images `(batch, channels, height, width)`
  * **5D tensor** → batch of video frames `(batch, frames, height, width, channels)`

In PyTorch / TensorFlow, everything is a **tensor** — vectors are 1D tensors, matrices are 2D tensors, images are often 4D tensors.

## **4. Visual Summary**

| Name            | Dimensions | Example              |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| **Scalar**      | 0D         | `7`                  |
| **Vector**      | 1D         | `[1, 2, 3]`          |
| **Matrix**      | 2D         | `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`  |
| **Tensor (3D)** | 3D         | `batch of sequences` |
| **Tensor (4D)** | 4D         | `batch of images`    |
| **Tensor (5D)** | 5D         | `batch of videos`    |

---

✅ So:

* Vector = 1D
* Matrix = 2D
* Tensor = nD (3D, 4D, 5D, … depending on problem)

Do you want me to show you a **NumPy example that builds scalar → vector → matrix → tensor step by step** so you can see the shapes directly?
