Letâ€™s go step by step into **class lock vs object lock in Java multithreading**.

---

## ðŸ”’ 1. Object Lock (Instance Lock)

* Every **Java object** has an **intrinsic monitor lock**.
* When you declare a **synchronized instance method** or use a `synchronized (this)` block, the **objectâ€™s lock** is acquired.
* Only **one thread per object instance** can hold the lock at a time.
* Different objects of the same class have different locks.

### Example: Object Lock

```java
class Printer {
    public synchronized void printDocs(String name) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println(name + " printing page " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class ObjectLockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer printer1 = new Printer();
        Printer printer2 = new Printer();

        // Thread-1 uses printer1
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> printer1.printDocs("Thread-1"));
        // Thread-2 also uses printer1 -> will block if t1 is printing
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> printer1.printDocs("Thread-2"));
        // Thread-3 uses printer2 -> no blocking with printer1
        Thread t3 = new Thread(() -> printer2.printDocs("Thread-3"));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here:

* `t1` and `t2` share the same object (`printer1`) â†’ they **synchronize** on the same object lock.
* `t3` uses a different object (`printer2`) â†’ runs **independently**.

---

## ðŸ”’ 2. Class Lock (Static Lock)

* Every **Java class** has a **Class object** (in metaspace).
* A `synchronized static` method uses the **class lock**, i.e., lock on the `Class` object.
* Ensures only one thread can execute **any static synchronized method** of that class at a time.
* The lock is **shared across all instances** of that class.

### Example: Class Lock

```java
class Database {
    public static synchronized void updateRecord(String threadName) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println(threadName + " updating record " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class ClassLockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Different threads, different objects, but static lock is shared
        Database db1 = new Database();
        Database db2 = new Database();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> db1.updateRecord("Thread-1"));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> db2.updateRecord("Thread-2"));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here:

* Even though `db1` and `db2` are **different objects**, the **static synchronized method** locks on `Database.class`.
* So `t1` and `t2` cannot run `updateRecord()` in parallel.

## ðŸ“Š Comparison Table

| Feature          | Object Lock (Instance Lock)                    | Class Lock (Static Lock)                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scope            | Per object instance                            | Per class (Class object)                                     |
| Used by          | `synchronized` instance methods / blocks       | `synchronized` static methods / blocks                       |
| Synchronization  | Only affects threads using the **same object** | Affects all threads using the class (regardless of instance) |
| Example Use Case | Printing per printer (per object lock)         | Updating a shared DB schema (class-level lock)               |

âœ… **Rule of Thumb:**

* Use **object locks** when synchronizing access to instance-specific data.
* Use **class locks** when synchronizing access to static data shared across all objects.

Would you like me to also **draw a diagram** (showing thread interactions with class lock vs object lock) to make it crystal clear?
