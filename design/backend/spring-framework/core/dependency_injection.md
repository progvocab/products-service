In Spring Framework, there are three main ways to implement dependency injection using autowiring: field-based, constructor-based, and setter-based autowiring. Field-based uses reflection to inject dependencies into class fields, while constructor-based injects them through the constructor, and setter-based uses setter methods. 
- 1. Field-based Autowiring:
Mechanism: Spring uses Java reflection to inject dependencies directly into the fields of a class. 
Example: @Autowired private MyService service;. 
Benefits: Simple to use and can be useful for small projects. 
Drawbacks: Can make unit testing harder and may not be suitable for larger projects. 
- 2. Constructor-based Autowiring:
Mechanism: Dependencies are injected through the constructor of a class.
Example: class MyClass { public MyClass(MyDependency dep) { this.dep = dep; } }.
Benefits: Makes dependencies explicit and immutable, simplifies unit testing, and is generally preferred for larger projects.
Drawbacks: Requires dependencies to be passed in the constructor, which might not always be feasible. 
- 3. Setter-based Autowiring:
Mechanism:
Dependencies are injected through setter methods of a class.
Example:
@Autowired public void setService(MyService service) { this.service = service; }.
Benefits:
Suitable for optional dependencies and can be used in conjunction with other injection methods.
Drawbacks:
Can be less explicit than constructor injection and might not be suitable for mandatory dependencies. 
Which one to choose?
Constructor-based
is generally recommended as the preferred approach, especially for mandatory dependencies, as it promotes immutability, simplifies testing, and makes dependencies explicit. 
Setter-based
is suitable for optional dependencies and can be used in conjunction with constructor-based injection. 
Field-based
is the simplest but should be used with caution, as it can make testing more complex and is not as recommended for larger projects. 

 Let’s dive deep into **Autowiring**, **Dependency Management**, and **Inversion of Control (IoC)** in **Spring Boot**, along with the **design patterns** and **annotations** involved.

---

## **1. What is Autowiring?**

**Autowiring** is a feature in Spring where the framework **automatically injects dependencies** into beans, reducing the need for manual wiring in configuration files or constructors.

It’s part of **Dependency Injection (DI)**, which is a core principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)**.

---

## **2. Types of Autowiring in Spring**

Spring provides **3 main types** of autowiring (when using annotations):

### **a. Field Based
### ** By Type (`@Autowired`)**

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeService employeeService;
```

- Injects a bean based on its **type** (`EmployeeService`).
- Throws error if multiple beans of the same type exist (unless resolved using `@Qualifier`).

---

### ** By Name (`@Autowired + @Qualifier`)**

```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("contractEmployeeService")
private EmployeeService employeeService;
```

- Uses both **type and bean name** to find the dependency.

---

### **b. Constructor-based Injection**

```java
@Component
public class EmployeeController {

    private final EmployeeService employeeService;

    @Autowired
    public EmployeeController(EmployeeService employeeService) {
        this.employeeService = employeeService;
    }
}
```

- Recommended by Spring (especially for required, immutable dependencies).
- Automatically used from Spring 4.3+ if there’s only one constructor.

### **c. Setter Based

- Dependencies are injected through setter methods of a class



---

### **d. Field-based vs Constructor-based vs Setter-based**

| Type          | Pros                                        | Cons                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Constructor   | Immutable, best for required dependencies   | Verbose for many dependencies       |
| Field         | Concise                                     | Hard to test, not recommended       |
| Setter        | Optional dependencies supported             | Allows mutability                   |

---

## **3. Spring Annotations for Dependency Management**

| Annotation        | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Autowired`     | Inject bean by type                                       |
| `@Qualifier`     | Resolve conflicts when multiple beans exist               |
| `@Primary`       | Mark one bean as the default when multiple candidates     |
| `@Component`     | Marks a class as a Spring-managed bean                    |
| `@Service`       | Specialized `@Component` for service layer                |
| `@Repository`    | Specialized `@Component` for DAO; enables exception translation |
| `@Controller`    | Specialized `@Component` for Spring MVC controller        |
| `@ComponentScan` | Scans packages for components                             |
| `@Bean`          | Defines a bean manually in `@Configuration` classes       |

---

## **4. Inversion of Control (IoC)**

**IoC** means that the control of creating objects is **inverted** — it's handled by the Spring **IoC container**, not by our code.

### **Example:**

Instead of:
```java
Service s = new Service();
```

You do:
```java
@Autowired
Service s;
```

Spring manages object lifecycle, dependencies, and scope.

## **5. Design Patterns Involved**

| Pattern                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dependency Injection** | Core concept; injects dependencies into objects rather than creating them  |
| **Factory**            | Spring IoC container acts as a factory for creating beans                   |
| **Singleton**          | Beans by default are singletons in Spring                                   |
| **Service Locator**    | Behind the scenes, used to locate and inject beans                          |
| **Proxy**              | Used for AOP, transactions, lazy loading                                    |

---

## **6. Dependency Management in Spring Boot**

Spring Boot uses **Spring’s dependency injection** and **Spring Boot Starter dependencies** for easy dependency management via Maven/Gradle.

### **Example:**
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- Provides everything you need for a RESTful web service (Tomcat, Jackson, etc.).
- You don’t need to explicitly list all dependencies.
