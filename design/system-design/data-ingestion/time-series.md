### **Relationship Between Sensor, Waveform, Spectrum, and Time Series Data**  

These concepts are interconnected in **signal processing, IoT, and data analysis**, where sensors capture physical phenomena, which are then analyzed in different forms.  

---

## **1. Sensor** (Data Source)  
A **sensor** is a device that detects and measures physical properties such as temperature, pressure, vibration, sound, or electromagnetic waves.  

**Example:**  
- A **microphone** captures sound waves  
- An **accelerometer** detects vibrations  
- A **radio antenna** measures electromagnetic signals  

### **Sensor Data → Generates Waveform**
Sensors collect data as a **continuous signal over time**, forming a **waveform**.  

---

## **2. Waveform** (Raw Signal Representation)  
A **waveform** is a graphical representation of a **continuous signal** captured by a sensor over time. It typically shows how a quantity (e.g., voltage, pressure, acceleration) **varies over time**.  

**Example:**  
- A **heart ECG sensor** records an **electrical waveform** of the heart  
- A **microphone** records a **sound waveform**  
- An **accelerometer** captures a **vibration waveform**  

### **Waveform → Time-Series Data**  
A waveform can be stored as **time-series data**, where each value is recorded at a specific timestamp.

---

## **3. Time Series Data** (Structured Waveform Data)  
**Time-series data** consists of a **sequence of measurements over time**. It is often sampled at **regular intervals** and stored in a structured form (e.g., database, CSV, or cloud storage).  

**Example:**  
| Timestamp       | Sensor Value |
|----------------|-------------|
| 2025-03-11 10:00:00 | 0.02        |
| 2025-03-11 10:00:01 | 0.05        |
| 2025-03-11 10:00:02 | 0.01        |

### **Time Series → Frequency Spectrum**  
A time-series signal can be transformed into a **frequency spectrum** using **Fourier Transform (FFT)**.

---

## **4. Spectrum** (Frequency Domain Representation)  
The **spectrum** shows how different frequencies contribute to a waveform. It is derived from time-series data using **Fourier Transform**.  

- **Low-frequency components** → Represent slow changes (e.g., DC signals)  
- **High-frequency components** → Represent rapid variations (e.g., noise, vibrations)  

**Example:**  
- **Audio signal (time-series)** → Convert to **frequency spectrum** to filter noise  
- **Vibration data (waveform)** → Spectrum analysis for fault detection in machines  

---

## **Final Relationship Overview**  
1. **Sensors** capture physical signals (temperature, sound, vibration).  
2. **Waveforms** represent the raw signal over time.  
3. **Time-series data** stores these waveforms as discrete measurements.  
4. **Spectrum analysis** converts time-series data to frequency components for deeper insights.

### **Example: Sound Analysis Using Python**  
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.fftpack import fft

# Generate a synthetic waveform (sine wave)
fs = 1000  # Sampling rate (Hz)
t = np.linspace(0, 1, fs)  # Time axis (1 second)
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 50 * t)  # 50 Hz sine wave

# Convert to frequency spectrum using FFT
freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(len(t), 1/fs)
spectrum = np.abs(fft(signal))

# Plot Waveform (Time-Series)
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
plt.plot(t, signal)
plt.title("Waveform (Time-Series)")
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")

# Plot Spectrum
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
plt.plot(freqs[:len(freqs)//2], spectrum[:len(spectrum)//2])  # Only positive frequencies
plt.title("Spectrum (Frequency Domain)")
plt.xlabel("Frequency (Hz)")
plt.show()
```
