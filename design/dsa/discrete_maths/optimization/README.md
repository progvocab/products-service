# üîë Optimization in Discrete Mathematics

Optimization = **finding the ‚Äúbest‚Äù solution** (max/min) subject to constraints.
In discrete math, variables take **integer or combinatorial values** (not continuous real numbers).

## 1. **Types of Discrete Optimization Problems**

* **Graph Optimization**

  * Shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
  * Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)
  * Max flow / Min cut (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic)
* **Combinatorial Optimization**

  * Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  * Assignment problem (Hungarian algorithm)
  * Knapsack problem (DP, greedy variants)
* **Integer Optimization**

  * Linear programming with integer constraints (ILP).
* **Constraint Satisfaction**

  * Scheduling, coloring, matching, tiling.

## 2. **Optimization Principles in Discrete Math**

### üîπ Greedy Method

* Make a **locally optimal choice** at each step.
* Works if problem has:

  * **Greedy-choice property**: local optimum ‚Üí global optimum.
  * **Optimal substructure**: optimal solution built from optimal subproblems.
* Examples:

  * Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim).
  * Activity selection problem.
  * Huffman coding.

---

### üîπ Dynamic Programming (DP)

* Solve overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure.
* Store results ‚Üí avoid recomputation.
* Examples:

  * Knapsack problem.
  * Shortest path in DAG.
  * Longest Increasing Subsequence.

---

### üîπ Divide and Conquer

* Break into subproblems, solve recursively, merge.
* Optimization: reduces exponential brute force to polylog.
* Examples:

  * Binary Search (optimization in search space).
  * Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  * Closest pair of points problem.

---

### üîπ Linear & Integer Programming

* Formulate problem as:

  $$
  \text{maximize/minimize } c^T x \quad \text{subject to } Ax \leq b, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n
  $$
* If `x` is integer ‚Üí **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**.
* Examples:

  * Scheduling tasks with deadlines.
  * Resource allocation problems.

---

### üîπ Approximation & Heuristics

* When exact optimization is NP-hard:

  * Use approximation algorithms (e.g., 2-approximation for Vertex Cover).
  * Heuristics: greedy, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms.

## 3. **Optimization Techniques by Problem Class**

| Problem Type      | Classic Optimization Approach                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shortest path** | Dijkstra (greedy), Bellman-Ford (DP), Floyd-Warshall (DP) |
| **Network flow**  | Max Flow-Min Cut (Ford-Fulkerson, Dinic)                  |
| **MST**           | Kruskal / Prim (greedy)                                   |
| **Knapsack**      | DP (0/1), Greedy (fractional)                             |
| **TSP**           | DP (Held-Karp), Branch & Bound, Approximation             |
| **Matching**      | Hungarian Algorithm (assignment problem)                  |
| **Scheduling**    | Greedy (earliest deadline first), ILP                     |
| **Set cover**     | Greedy approximation (log n factor)                       |

* **Number Theory**: modular arithmetic for constraints.
* **Combinatorics**: counting feasible solutions.
* **Boolean algebra**: SAT, optimization over logic constraints.
* **Recurrences**: analyze algorithm time/space complexity.

## 5. **Examples in Competitive Programming**

1. **Knapsack Problem (DP)** ‚Üí minimize/maximize value subject to capacity.
2. **Activity Selection (Greedy)** ‚Üí choose max tasks without overlap.
3. **Job Scheduling (Greedy + DP)** ‚Üí weighted interval scheduling.
4. **Network Flow** ‚Üí bipartite matching, assignment.
5. **Binary Search on Answer** (discrete optimization trick) ‚Üí e.g., minimize max distance, minimize time.

‚úÖ **In short:**
Optimization in discrete mathematics = applying **greedy, DP, graph algorithms, integer programming, or approximation** to minimize/maximize objectives in **combinatorial settings**.
