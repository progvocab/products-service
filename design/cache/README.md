# **Caching Strategies**

---

## **1. Client-Side Caching**

* **Where**: On the client (browser, mobile app, local memory, or disk).
* **Purpose**: Reduce network requests and improve response time.
* **How**:

  * Browser caches static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images) using headers like:

    * `Cache-Control`
    * `Expires`
    * `ETag` (for validation)
  * Application caches API responses locally.
* **Pros**:

  * Reduces server load.
  * Fastest access since data is local.
* **Cons**:

  * Cache may become stale.
  * Difficult to enforce consistency.

**Example**: Browser caching a static image or CSS file.

## **2. Server-Side Caching**

* **Where**: On the server (application server memory, reverse proxy like NGINX, or CDN).
* **Purpose**: Reduce database load, accelerate response time.
* **How**:

  * Store frequently accessed data in memory (Redis, Memcached).
  * Reverse proxy caches full HTTP responses (NGINX, Varnish).
  * Application-level caching of queries or computations.
* **Pros**:

  * Centralized control over cache.
  * Can handle large datasets.
* **Cons**:

  * Needs memory management.
  * Still a single point if not distributed.

**Example**: Caching query results for a popular API endpoint in Redis.

## **3. Distributed Caching**

* **Where**: Across multiple servers/nodes (clustered cache).
* **Purpose**: Handle high scale, reduce load on DB, provide fault tolerance.
* **How**:

  * Use distributed cache systems like Redis Cluster, Memcached Cluster, Hazelcast.
  * Data partitioned across nodes using **consistent hashing**.
  * Can implement replication for fault tolerance.
* **Pros**:

  * Scales horizontally.
  * Fault-tolerant if nodes fail.
* **Cons**:

  * More complex setup.
  * Cache consistency is harder.

**Example**: Large-scale e-commerce platform caching product details across multiple Redis nodes.

## **4. CDN (Content Delivery Network) Caching**

* **Where**: At the network edge, closer to clients.
* **Purpose**: Reduce latency by serving static content quickly worldwide.
* **How**:

  * Cache static content at edge servers.
  * Edge caches pull from origin server if content not present.
* **Pros**:

  * Very low latency.
  * Offloads traffic from origin servers.
* **Cons**:

  * Hard to invalidate cached content quickly.
  * Mostly for static content, not dynamic data.

**Example**: Serving images, JS, CSS files via Cloudflare or Akamai CDN.

---

## **5. Database-Level Caching**

* **Where**: Inside or close to the database.
* **Purpose**: Reduce read latency and DB load.
* **How**:

  * Query result caching (PostgreSQL query cache, MySQL query cache).
  * Materialized views for expensive joins/aggregations.
* **Pros**:

  * Reduces database CPU/memory usage.
* **Cons**:

  * Needs cache invalidation strategies.

---

## **6. Cache Invalidation Strategies**

* **Time-Based (TTL)**: Cache expires after set duration.
* **Event-Based**: Cache invalidated when underlying data changes.
* **Lazy / On-Demand**: Fetch fresh data only if cache miss occurs.

| Client-side    | Browser / App             | Static assets, API responses          | Fast, reduces server load        | Stale data, limited control                         |
| Server-side    | App server, reverse proxy | Frequently accessed DB results        | Central control, fast            | Limited by server memory                            |

| CDN            | Edge network              | Static files, media                   | Low latency, reduces origin load | Mainly static content, cache invalidation difficult |
| Database-level | DB or close               | Expensive queries, materialized views | Reduces DB load                  | Needs invalidation strategies                       |

If you want, I can **draw a clean Mermaid diagram showing all these caching layers in a web app architecture**, which helps visualize how client, server, DB, and CDN caches interact.

Do you want me to do that?
