The `.github/workflows` folder is a **special directory in a GitHub repository** used to define **GitHub Actions workflows**.

### Purpose:

It contains **YAML configuration files** that define **automated workflows** (like CI/CD pipelines) triggered by events such as push, pull request, release, schedule, etc.

---

### Example File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: Java CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '21'
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install
```

---

### Common Use Cases:

* Run unit tests on every pull request
* Deploy application to cloud on release
* Lint and format code on push
* Schedule jobs like backups or metrics collection

### Related Concepts:

* **GitHub Actions**: The automation platform
* **Events**: Triggers like `push`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`
* **Jobs & Steps**: Units of execution defined in the workflow file
