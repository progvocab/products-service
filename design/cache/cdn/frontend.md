Perfect ‚Äî this is one of the most **common real-world deployment setups** üëá

Let‚Äôs say you have a **React app** built and deployed on a **Linux server (e.g., EC2, VPS, or on-prem)** ‚Äî and you now want to put a **CDN (like CloudFront or Cloudflare)** in front of it to improve speed, availability, and caching.

We‚Äôll go step by step.

You currently have something like:

* Nginx serving `/var/www/myapp/build`
* Domain: `myapp.example.com`
* HTTPS via Nginx (maybe using Let‚Äôs Encrypt)

## üß† What the CDN Caches

CDN caches **static build artifacts** from your React app:

| Type      | Examples                | Cached by CDN?                          |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| HTML      | `index.html`            | ‚úÖ Yes (short cache time)                |
| JS        | `main.js`, `vendors.js` | ‚úÖ Yes (long cache time)                 |
| CSS       | `main.css`              | ‚úÖ Yes (long cache time)                 |
| Images    | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`  | ‚úÖ Yes                                   |
| API calls | `/api/...` (JSON)       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only if configured and safe to cache |

## ü™ú Steps to Add CDN in Front of Your React App

### **Step 1 ‚Äî Make sure your React app is deployed and accessible**

Your Linux server should serve the app, e.g.:

```bash
curl -I https://myapp.example.com
```

You should get a `200 OK` with `Content-Type: text/html`.

---

### **Step 2 ‚Äî Choose your CDN**

Two main options:

* **AWS CloudFront** (best if you‚Äôre in AWS)
* **Cloudflare** (simpler setup if you use your own domain DNS)

Let‚Äôs go through both üëá

---

## üöÄ Option 1: AWS CloudFront (recommended for AWS setup)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a CloudFront distribution

* **Origin domain** ‚Üí your Linux server‚Äôs public domain or IP
  (e.g. `myapp.example.com` or `1.2.3.4`)
* **Origin protocol policy** ‚Üí `HTTPS only`
* **Viewer protocol policy** ‚Üí `Redirect HTTP to HTTPS`
* **Cache behavior**:

  * Path pattern: `*`
  * Allowed methods: `GET, HEAD`
  * Cache policy: `CachingOptimized`
  * Compress objects automatically: ‚úÖ Yes
* **Alternate domain name (CNAME)**: `myapp.example.com`
* **SSL certificate**: from AWS ACM (for your domain)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update DNS

* In Route53 (or wherever your DNS is managed), update:

  ```
  myapp.example.com  ‚Üí  CloudFront Distribution URL
  ```

Example:

```
CNAME myapp.example.com d12345abcdef.cloudfront.net
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Nginx cache headers on your server

Add in your Nginx site config:

```nginx
location / {
    root /var/www/myapp/build;
    index index.html;
    try_files $uri /index.html;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" always;
}
```

This allows CDN to cache assets efficiently.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Invalidate CloudFront cache (when deploying new builds)

Whenever you deploy a new React version:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id <YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID> \
  --paths "/*"
```

---

## ‚ö° Option 2: Cloudflare (simpler DNS-based CDN)

1. Create a free Cloudflare account
2. Add your domain (Cloudflare scans existing DNS records)
3. Proxy your domain through Cloudflare (orange cloud = active)
4. Set **Page Rules** or **Cache Rules**:

   * Cache static assets (`*.js`, `*.css`, `*.png`, etc.)
   * Don‚Äôt cache HTML or API calls.

Example Page Rule:

```
If URL matches *myapp.example.com/static/*
Cache Level: Cache Everything
Edge Cache TTL: a month
```

Cloudflare will automatically compress, cache, and serve your assets globally.

## üß© Deployment Recap

| Component                     | Responsibility                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| React app (build folder)      | Static HTML, CSS, JS                      |
| Nginx on Linux                | Serves static files over HTTPS            |
| CDN (CloudFront / Cloudflare) | Caches and serves content closer to users |
| DNS                           | Points to CDN distribution                |

---

## üß† Bonus: Handling APIs

If your React app calls `/api/...` endpoints:

* You can proxy them via Nginx or CDN rules.
* Example Nginx config:

  ```nginx
  location /api/ {
      proxy_pass http://backend-server:8080;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
  ```
* CDN should **not cache API responses** unless they are public/static.

Or do you plan to use **Cloudflare**?
