 Letâ€™s dive into **deadlock detection using cycles** in Java multithreading.

---

# ðŸ”¹ What is Deadlock?

Deadlock occurs when:

* Two or more threads are waiting for resources **held by each other**.
* None of them can proceed â†’ infinite waiting.

Example:

* Thread A holds **Lock1**, waits for **Lock2**.
* Thread B holds **Lock2**, waits for **Lock1**.
  â†’ Deadlock.

---

# ðŸ”¹ Deadlock Detection Using Cycle

We can model deadlocks with a **Wait-for Graph**:

* **Nodes** = Threads.
* **Edges** = "Thread T is waiting for a resource held by Thread U".

ðŸ‘‰ If this graph contains a **cycle**, deadlock exists.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Example

Two threads:

* **Thread 1**: holds Lock A, waiting for Lock B.
* **Thread 2**: holds Lock B, waiting for Lock A.

Wait-for Graph:

```
Thread1 â†’ Thread2
Thread2 â†’ Thread1
```

* Thereâ€™s a cycle (`T1 â†’ T2 â†’ T1`).
* This cycle means **deadlock detected**.

# ðŸ”¹ Deadlock Detection in Practice (Java)

Java itself **does not automatically resolve deadlocks**, but we can detect them:

### 1. **Using ThreadMXBean**

```java
import java.lang.management.*;

public class DeadlockDetection {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ThreadMXBean bean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();

        long[] threadIds = bean.findDeadlockedThreads(); // Detect deadlocked threads
        if (threadIds != null) {
            ThreadInfo[] infos = bean.getThreadInfo(threadIds);
            System.out.println("Deadlock detected!");
            for (ThreadInfo info : infos) {
                System.out.println(info.getThreadName() + " is in deadlock");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("No deadlock detected");
        }
    }
}
```

* JVM analyzes the **wait-for graph internally**.
* If it finds a cycle â†’ reports deadlocked threads.

---

### 2. **Manual Cycle Detection (Conceptual)**

* Build a wait-for graph yourself:

  * Record which thread holds which lock.
  * Record which lock each thread is waiting for.
* Apply **cycle detection algorithms** (DFS, Tarjanâ€™s strongly connected components).
* If a cycle exists â†’ deadlock.

---

# ðŸ”¹ How to Avoid Deadlock (Cycle Prevention)

* **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in the same global order.
* **Try-Lock with Timeout**: Use `lock.tryLock(timeout)` instead of `lock.lock()`.
* **Deadlock Detection + Restart**: Detect cycle, then kill/restart one thread.

---

âœ… **In short**:
Deadlock detection is based on **finding cycles in the wait-for graph**. JVM internally does this via `ThreadMXBean`.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also show you a **Java code example that creates a deadlock** (two threads locking each other) so we can then detect it with `ThreadMXBean`?
