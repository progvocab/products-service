## **Internal Caching in PostgreSQL**  

PostgreSQL **internally caches** data to improve performance and reduce disk I/O. Unlike some databases that rely heavily on their own caching mechanisms, PostgreSQL **leverages the OS's page cache** and provides additional **internal caches** for query optimization.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Caches in PostgreSQL**
PostgreSQL caching primarily consists of:
1. **Shared Buffers (Data Cache)**
2. **WAL Buffers (Write-Ahead Log Cache)**
3. **Work Memory (Sort & Hash Cache)**
4. **OS Page Cache**
5. **Query Execution Plan Cache (Prepared Statements)**

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Shared Buffers (PostgreSQL Data Cache)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Caches frequently accessed **data pages** and **index pages** in memory.  
  - Reduces disk I/O by serving queries from RAM.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When a query requests a data page, PostgreSQL first checks the **Shared Buffers**.  
  - If the page is **in cache (cache hit)** ‚Üí It is served from memory (fast).  
  - If the page is **not in cache (cache miss)** ‚Üí It is fetched from disk (slow).  

- **Configuration (`postgresql.conf`):**
  ```ini
  shared_buffers = 4GB  # Recommended: 25-40% of total RAM
  ```
  
- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Essential for **read-heavy workloads**.  
  - Higher **shared_buffers** = More queries served from memory = **Better performance**.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ WAL Buffers (Write-Ahead Log Cache)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Temporarily stores changes before writing them to the **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** on disk.  
  - Reduces **disk writes** and improves transaction performance.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When a transaction modifies data, the changes are first stored in the **WAL Buffers**.  
  - If the buffer fills up or a commit occurs, the WAL data is written to disk.  

- **Configuration (`postgresql.conf`):**
  ```ini
  wal_buffers = 16MB  # Default: Auto-tuned (0.5MB to a few MB)
  ```

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Larger **wal_buffers** improve transaction throughput for **write-heavy workloads**.  
  - Critical for **high-concurrency databases**.  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Work Memory (Sorting & Hash Join Cache)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Allocates memory for sorting, hashing, and aggregations.  
  - Reduces the need for **temporary disk storage** during query execution.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When executing **ORDER BY, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, and JOIN operations**, PostgreSQL first attempts to sort data in memory.  
  - If sorting exceeds **work_mem**, temporary files are used (slower).  

- **Configuration (`postgresql.conf`):**
  ```ini
  work_mem = 64MB  # Adjust per session/workload
  ```

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Increasing **work_mem** prevents queries from spilling to disk.  
  - Recommended for **complex queries with large joins and sorts**.  

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ OS Page Cache (Linux Kernel Caching)**
- **What it does:**  
  - PostgreSQL relies on the **operating system's page cache** to store recently accessed database files.  
  - Speeds up queries by **reducing disk I/O**.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When PostgreSQL fetches a data page from disk, Linux stores it in the **OS Page Cache**.  
  - If the same page is needed again, it is served from RAM instead of disk.  

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Larger **free RAM** = More pages cached = **Faster queries**.  
  - Tuning **`effective_cache_size`** helps PostgreSQL estimate available OS cache.  

- **Configuration (`postgresql.conf`):**
  ```ini
  effective_cache_size = 8GB  # Approximate available OS Page Cache
  ```

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Query Execution Plan Cache (Prepared Statements)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Caches **execution plans** for repeated queries.  
  - Reduces query planning overhead for frequently executed SQL statements.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When using **prepared statements**, PostgreSQL stores the query plan in cache.  
  - If the same query runs again, PostgreSQL reuses the plan instead of recomputing it.  

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  PREPARE my_query AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = $1;
  EXECUTE my_query ('HR');
  ```
  
- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Greatly improves performance for **repeated queries** (e.g., API calls).  
  - Used in **PostgreSQL connection pooling** (e.g., **pgbouncer**).

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring PostgreSQL Cache Usage**
### **1. Check Cache Hit Ratio**
Run this SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
    (blks_hit::float / (blks_read + blks_hit) * 100) AS cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname = 'your_database';
```
- **90%+ is ideal** (i.e., most queries served from cache).  

### **2. Check Shared Buffer Usage**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_buffercache LIMIT 10;
```

### **3. Check Temporary Disk Usage (Bad for Performance)**
```sql
SELECT sum(temp_bytes) AS temp_disk_used
FROM pg_stat_statements;
```
- **High temp usage** ‚Üí Increase **work_mem**.

## **8Ô∏è‚É£ When to Tune Each Cache?**
| **Cache Type** | **Best for** | **Tuning Parameter** | **Impact** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Shared Buffers** | Read-heavy workloads | `shared_buffers` | üîº Speeds up SELECT queries |
| **WAL Buffers** | Write-heavy workloads | `wal_buffers` | üîº Improves transaction commits |
| **Work Memory** | Complex queries (JOIN, ORDER BY) | `work_mem` | üîº Prevents temp files |
| **OS Page Cache** | General Performance | `effective_cache_size` | üîº Reduces disk I/O |
| **Query Execution Cache** | Repeated Queries | `PREPARE` Statements | üîº Avoids query planning overhead |

## **9Ô∏è‚É£ Summary: PostgreSQL Caching vs Cassandra Caching**
| Feature | **PostgreSQL** | **Cassandra** |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Key Cache** | Shared Buffers | Key Cache |
| **Row Cache** | OS Page Cache + Work Memory | Row Cache |
| **WAL Cache** | WAL Buffers | Commit Log |

## **üîπ Final Thoughts**
- **PostgreSQL caching heavily depends on the OS Page Cache** and **Shared Buffers**.  
- **Read-heavy workloads benefit from tuning `shared_buffers` and `effective_cache_size`**.  
- **Write-heavy workloads should optimize `wal_buffers` and transaction settings**.  
- **Complex queries require proper `work_mem` tuning** to avoid disk usage.
