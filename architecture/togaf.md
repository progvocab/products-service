### **What is TOGAF? (The Open Group Architecture Framework)**  

**TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)** is a **framework for enterprise architecture (EA)** that helps organizations **design, plan, implement, and manage IT architectures** in a structured and efficient way.  

---

## **1. Why Use TOGAF?**  
✅ **Standardized approach** for developing enterprise architecture  
✅ **Aligns business strategy with IT** infrastructure  
✅ **Ensures interoperability and scalability**  
✅ **Reduces costs and risks in IT projects**

## **2. Key Components of TOGAF**  

| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** | Step-by-step process for building enterprise architecture |
| **Enterprise Continuum** | Repository of best practices and models for reuse |
| **Architecture Content Framework** | Defines **deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks** |
| **Reference Models** | **Technical and business reference architectures** to guide implementation |

## **3. TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method)**  
TOGAF uses a **phased approach** to develop enterprise architecture:  

### **Phases in ADM**
1. **Preliminary Phase** → Define architecture principles and governance  
2. **Phase A: Architecture Vision** → Identify business goals & architecture scope  
3. **Phase B: Business Architecture** → Define business processes & organizational structure  
4. **Phase C: Information Systems Architecture** → Define data & application architecture  
5. **Phase D: Technology Architecture** → Define infrastructure, platforms, networks  
6. **Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions** → Identify implementation projects  
7. **Phase F: Migration Planning** → Develop roadmap for architecture implementation  
8. **Phase G: Implementation Governance** → Monitor execution & enforce compliance  
9. **Phase H: Architecture Change Management** → Manage future changes & updates
