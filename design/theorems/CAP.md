The **CAP Theorem** is **not** a design pattern or design principle ‚Äî it is a **theoretical concept** or **theorem in distributed systems** that describes the fundamental **trade-offs** you must consider when designing distributed databases or services.

## üß† What is the CAP Theorem?

> The CAP Theorem (also known as **Brewer‚Äôs Theorem**) states that in any distributed data system, you can only **guarantee two** out of the following **three** properties at the same time:

| Property                    | Meaning                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C ‚Äì Consistency**         | Every read receives the most recent write (all nodes agree on the data) |
| **A ‚Äì Availability**        | Every request gets a (non-error) response ‚Äî even if some nodes are down |
| **P ‚Äì Partition Tolerance** | The system continues to work despite network failures between nodes     |

### ‚úÖ Visual Summary

```
             Consistency
                /\
               /  \
              /    \
             /      \
     Availability   Partition Tolerance
```

You can **pick only two** ‚Äî you must **sacrifice one** in a network partition.

## üö¶ Real-World Examples

| System                                      | Prioritizes                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CP** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)  | MongoDB (default), HBase                                                                        |
| **AP** (Availability + Partition Tolerance) | Couchbase, Cassandra                                                                            |
| **CA** (Consistency + Availability)         | Rare; only works if there's no partition (i.e., single-node systems or tightly coupled systems) |

## ‚úÖ Is CAP a Design Pattern or Principle?

| Term                 | Is CAP related? | Explanation                                                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Design Pattern**   | ‚ùå No            | Design patterns are **reusable software structures** (e.g., Singleton, Strategy, Observer) |
| **Design Principle** | ‚ùå No            | Principles are **guidelines** for software design (e.g., SOLID, DRY, KISS)                 |
| **Theorem**          | ‚úÖ Yes           | CAP is a **fundamental law** in distributed systems ‚Äî a constraint you must consider       |

---

## üîÑ How it Affects System Design

* CAP doesn't tell you *how* to design ‚Äî it tells you **what you can't have all at once**.
* When designing distributed services, especially databases or microservices, **understanding CAP** helps make **informed trade-offs**.
