Alright, let's go deep into **database normalization**!

You gave me these sample columns and data:

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

Now, let's **apply all 6 Normal Forms** step by step:

---

# 1. **Unnormalized Form (UNF)**

- Raw table (repeating groups allowed)
- Reportees are not atomic (they are "Alex | Jenny" — multi-valued)

**Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

# 2. **First Normal Form (1NF)**

- **Atomic values only**.
- **No multi-valued attributes**.

**Fix:** Split reportees into multiple rows (or another table).

**Table (Option 1: Multiple Rows):**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportee | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex     | Manager     |
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Jenny    | Manager     |

**OR (Option 2: Create a separate Reportees Table):**

**Employees Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Manager     |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

# 3. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

- **Already in 1NF**
- **No partial dependency** on part of a composite key.

Since the primary key is just Employee Name (single field) or Employee ID if added, **and all non-key columns depend entirely** on it, **this satisfies 2NF**.

Nothing changes here.

---

# 4. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

- **No transitive dependencies** (i.e., non-key attribute → another non-key attribute).

**Possible Issue:**  
City may imply some attributes like State or Country (not given now). If city determines another attribute (e.g., state), split it.

**Otherwise**, current schema looks OK for 3NF.

---

# 5. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

- Stricter version of 3NF.
- Every determinant must be a candidate key.

Here, `Employee Name` uniquely identifies salary, city, designation, so no problem.

If `Designation` determines `Salary` (say all Managers always have salary 1000), we'd need to **separate Designation-Salary**:

**Designation Table (if needed):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

Then Employee Table:

| Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | New York | Manager     |

---

# 6. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- Deals with **multi-valued dependencies**.

**Problem:**  
Bob has **multiple reportees** independently.  
We already fixed this by creating a separate **Reportees Table** in 1NF.

Thus, 4NF is **already achieved**.

---

# 7. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- **Join dependency** — no lossless join issues.

Since we split Reportees properly, and there's no weird multi-table dependencies, it's fine.

If a complex relationship (e.g., Managers to Departments and Locations separately) existed, we'd split further.

---

# 8. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)** _(rarely used, but for completeness)_

- Decompose into **irreducible** tables based on time-variability.
- Used in temporal databases.

If Bob’s **Salary** changes over time, or **Designation** changes over time, you'd **timestamp** them:

**Employee Salary History Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| Bob           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

Similarly for Designation.

---

# **Summary Table**

| Normal Form | Action Taken |
|:------------|:-------------|
| UNF         | Original data with multi-values |
| 1NF         | Atomic fields (split reportees) |
| 2NF         | All non-key fields depend on the whole key |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency |
| BCNF        | No dependency anomalies |
| 4NF         | No multi-valued dependencies |
| 5NF         | No join dependencies |
| 6NF         | Temporal decomposition if needed |

---

# **Final Structure**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| 1           | Bob           | New York | Manager     |

**Salary History Table:**

| Employee ID | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| 1           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| 1           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

**Designation Table (Optional):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

---

# **Quick Visual**
```plaintext
Employee ---> Reportees (1:N)
Employee ---> SalaryHistory (1:N)
Employee ---> Designation (N:1)
```

---

Would you also like me to create an **ER Diagram** and **SQL script** for this normalized structure?  
(so you can directly visualize and implement it!)  
Let me know!  
It'll be very neat!

Good update!  
You added two new columns:

- **Zip Code**
- **Grade** (where Designation depends on Grade)

Now **dependencies** have become richer. Let’s rework **normalization** step-by-step.

---

# **New Table (Unnormalized / Raw Form)**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Reportees | Designation | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:------------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Alex\|Jenny | Manager     | A1   |

---

# **New Observations:**

- **City depends on Zip Code** (Zip → City)
- **Designation depends on Grade** (Grade → Designation)
- **Reportees** are multi-valued (Alex\|Jenny)
  
---

# **Normalization Steps**

## 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)** — Atomic Columns

**Problem:** Reportees column is multi-valued ("Alex | Jenny").  
**Fix:** Split reportees into a **separate table**.

---
**Employee Table (1NF):**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1   |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)** — Full Dependency on Key

Since the Employee table now uses **Employee ID** as Primary Key,  
each column depends entirely on Employee ID — no partial dependency.

No additional changes needed here.

---

## 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)** — No Transitive Dependencies

Now:

- `Zip Code` determines `City`
- `Grade` determines `Designation`

> This means **City** and **Designation** should be **moved into separate tables**, to remove transitive dependencies.

---

**New Structure for 3NF:**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1    |

---

**Zip Code Table:**

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |

---

**Grade Table:**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A1    | Manager     |

---

**Reportees Table (unchanged):**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

Every determinant must be a candidate key.  
✅ `Zip Code` uniquely determines `City`.  
✅ `Grade` uniquely determines `Designation`.

Hence after the above split, **BCNF is achieved**.

---

## 5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- No multi-valued dependency.
- Reportees are in a different table → good.
- No other multi-valued dependencies.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- No complex join dependencies.
- We have broken down the database logically.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 7. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)**

- Handle temporal data separately.
- If **Salary** or **Grade** or **Zip Code** changes over time, maintain a **history table**.

(Usually optional unless handling time-variant data)

---

# **Final Database Structure after Full Normalization**

### **Employee Table**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|

### **Zip Code Table**

| Zip Code | City |

### **Grade Table**

| Grade | Designation |

### **Reportees Table**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |

---

# **Dependencies (Functional Dependencies)**

| Dependency               | Meaning                     |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Zip Code → City           | Zip uniquely identifies City |
| Grade → Designation       | Grade uniquely identifies Designation |
| Employee ID → Salary, Zip, Grade, Name | Employee uniquely identifies other info |

---

# **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**

```
Employee (EmployeeID) 
    --> ZipCode (ZipCode) --> City
    --> Grade (Grade) --> Designation
    --> Reportees (ManagerID -> ReporteeName)
```

---

# **Summary of Changes due to New Columns:**

| Aspect           | Change made |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Multi-valued reportees | Split into separate Reportees table |
| Transitive dependency ZipCode → City | Moved City to separate ZipCode Table |
| Transitive dependency Grade → Designation | Moved Designation to separate Grade Table |
| Dependency simplification | Employee ID links all pieces of data cleanly |

---

# **Would you like me to also create:**

- SQL Scripts?
- Insert sample data?
- Show how queries would look after normalization?
- Show a Spring Data JPA Repository model for this?

It will give a full practical feel!  
Shall I continue? (it’ll be beautiful and very clear!)  
Let me know!
Perfect — let's do this carefully.

You asked to **add** two columns to the existing table:  
- **Project ID**  
- **Project Role**

And then **show the changes** for **all 6 normal forms** (1NF → 6NF).

I'll **start from your previous table**:

---

# **Initial Table (Before Normalization)**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Reportees      | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:---------------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Alex \| Jenny | Manager     | A     | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | -              | Developer   | B     | P102       | Developer    |

- **Problems:**  
  - Reportees column is **multi-valued** ("Alex | Jenny").  
  - **City** depends on **Zip Code** (not Employee Name).
  - **Designation** depends on **Grade**.
  - **Partial dependency** possible if `(Employee Name, Project ID)` is a composite key.

---

# **Normalization step-by-step**

---

## **1NF — Remove multi-valued columns, atomic values only**

### Changes:
- Split reportees into separate rows or a new table.
- Keep each field atomic.

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Manager     | A     | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | Developer   | B     | P102       | Developer    |

Separate **Reportees** into a new table:

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

## **2NF — Remove partial dependency**

Assuming **composite key** `(Employee Name, Project ID)`:
- Salary, City, Zip Code, Grade, Designation depend **only** on Employee Name → **Partial dependency**.

### Changes:
**Split into two tables**:

**Employee Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Grade | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | A     | Manager     |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | B     | Developer   |

**Employee Project Table:**

| Employee Name | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | P102       | Developer    |

---

## **3NF — Remove transitive dependency**

- City depends on Zip Code → Transitive dependency via Zip Code.
- Designation depends on Grade → Transitive dependency via Grade.

### Changes:
Create lookup tables.

**ZipCode Table:**

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |
| 02101    | Boston   |

**Grade Table:**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A     | Manager     |
| B     | Developer   |

**Now Employee Table becomes:**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

(Notice: no direct City or Designation here — only references!)

---

## **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**

- Every determinant must be a candidate key.
-  
**Already achieved** because:
  - Employee Name is primary key for Employee.
  - Zip Code is primary key for ZipCode Table.
  - Grade is primary key for Grade Table.

---

## **4NF — Remove multi-valued dependencies**

- No independent multi-valued facts in same table.
-  
**Already achieved**, because:
  - Reportees are separated into a different table.

---

## **5NF — Remove join dependencies**

- Decompose tables further if needed, to avoid lossless joins.
-  
In this simple case, **5NF is achieved**.  
(Real cases arise when one fact depends on multiple joins.)

---

## **6NF — Table decomposed to irreducible form (theoretical)**

- Fully decomposed into smallest meaningful parts.
- Useful mainly in Temporal Databases (versioned records).
-  
**Not necessary** here unless you introduce **time-based changes** to salaries, projects, etc.

---

# **Summary of New Tables**

### 1. Employee Table

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

### 2. ZipCode Table

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |
| 02101    | Boston   |

### 3. Grade Table

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A     | Manager     |
| B     | Developer   |

### 4. Employee Project Table

| Employee Name | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | P102       | Developer    |

### 5. Manager-Reportees Table

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

# **Visual Diagram**

If you'd like, I can also draw a **simple ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** showing the relations (like One-to-Many, Foreign Keys) —  
Would you like me to do that too?  
It'll be very easy to understand at a glance!  
**(Should I draw it?)**

Alright — let’s **deliberately add new columns** to the **Employee table** that will cause **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** violations.  
Then, I'll show you **what needs to be fixed**.

---

# **Current Clean Employee Table (after 3NF)**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

---

# **Now, let's add some problematic columns**

Let's add these two columns:

- **Manager Name** → (who the employee reports to)  
- **Office Location** → (depends on Zip Code)

Updated table:

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade | Manager Name | Office Location |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|:-------------|:----------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     | John         | New York, 5th Ave |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     | Steve        | Boston, Main St  |

---

# **Where is the problem now?**

- **Manager Name** may not uniquely depend on Employee Name (in some orgs, multiple employees have same manager).  
- **Office Location** depends **only on Zip Code**, not on Employee Name directly.

**Thus, not all determinants are candidate keys!**  
This **violates BCNF**.

---

# **BCNF requires:**
> "For every functional dependency X → Y, X must be a superkey."

Currently:
- `Zip Code → Office Location`  
- `Employee Name → Salary, Zip Code, Grade, Manager Name`

Here, **Zip Code** is **not a superkey** in Employee Table.  
(So we violate BCNF.)

---

# **How to Fix This? (BCNF solution)**

### 1. Move Office Location to a new table:

**Zip Code Table:**

| Zip Code | Office Location  |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| 10001    | New York, 5th Ave |
| 02101    | Boston, Main St   |

Employee table keeps only Zip Code (as Foreign Key).

---

### 2. Fix Manager Relationship

Manager relationship could be moved to **Manager Table**:

| Manager Name | Department (or ID) |
|:-------------|:-------------------|
| John         | Sales               |
| Steve        | Tech                |

And link employees via Manager ID, **NOT** store Manager Name directly (otherwise redundancy if manager info changes).

(Or a self-referencing FK if employees themselves are managers.)

---

# **Final Clean Tables after BCNF Fixes**

### **Employee Table**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade | Manager Name |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     | John         |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     | Steve        |

(Manager Name could still be normalized further if needed.)

---

### **Zip Code Table**

| Zip Code | Office Location  |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| 10001    | New York, 5th Ave |
| 02101    | Boston, Main St   |

---

### **Optional: Manager Table**

| Manager Name | Department |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| John         | Sales      |
| Steve        | Tech       |

---

# **In short:**

| What We Added         | What Happened          | How To Fix            |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
| Office Location        | Depends only on Zip Code, not Employee Name | Move to separate ZipCode table |
| Manager Name           | Might cause redundancy, not normalized | Optionally create Manager table |

---

# **Summary**
Adding "Manager Name" and "Office Location" introduced functional dependencies where a non-candidate attribute determined another non-prime attribute — exactly what BCNF forbids!

We **fixed it** by **splitting the tables** based on those dependencies.

---

Would you like me to also show a **small ER diagram** after these changes?  
(Visual makes this much clearer!)  
**Shall I draw it?**
