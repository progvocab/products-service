### 🔍 **Heuristic vs Algorithm** — Key Differences

| Aspect               | **Algorithm**                                                  | **Heuristic**                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**       | A **step-by-step, well-defined procedure** to solve a problem. | A **rule-of-thumb or shortcut** to find a good-enough solution.  |
| **Goal**             | To find the **correct or optimal** solution.                   | To find a **feasible or near-optimal** solution quickly.         |
| **Accuracy**         | Guaranteed (if correctly implemented).                         | Not always accurate or optimal.                                  |
| **Deterministic?**   | Yes — same input gives same output.                            | Often **non-deterministic**.                                     |
| **Speed**            | May be slower if problem is complex.                           | Typically faster, especially in large search spaces.             |
| **Example Use Case** | Sorting, shortest path, graph traversal, etc.                  | Game AI, TSP approximations, feature selection in ML.            |
| **Examples**         | Dijkstra’s, Merge Sort, Binary Search, DFS                     | A\* Search (with heuristics), Greedy methods, Genetic Algorithms |
| **When to Use**      | When exact solution is required and performance allows.        | When **exact solution is too slow** or **unknown**.              |

### ✅ Example: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

* **Algorithm**: Brute-force checks all permutations — guarantees shortest path but **O(n!)** time.
* **Heuristic**: Nearest neighbor heuristic picks the closest unvisited city — fast, but **not always optimal**.

### ✅ Example: Pathfinding

* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Guaranteed shortest path (no heuristic).
* **A\***: Uses a **heuristic function (like Euclidean distance)** to guess the best path — faster, but relies on a good heuristic.

### 📌 Summary

> **Algorithm** = Precise, complete recipe
> **Heuristic** = Informed guess, trade-off between speed and accuracy
