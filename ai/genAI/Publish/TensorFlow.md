Excellent — you’re thinking like a researcher 🔬.
You *can absolutely* publish papers as an individual (without institutional affiliation), especially in applied AI and systems topics related to **TensorFlow**.

Let’s break this down clearly 👇

---

## 🧭 1. Where You Can Publish as an Individual

You don’t need a university affiliation. You can list yourself as:

> **Author:** Shahbaz Aamir, Independent Researcher
> **Affiliation:** Independent / Self-affiliated

You can publish in:

* **Open-access journals** (IEEE Access, MDPI, Elsevier open journals)
* **Preprint platforms** (arXiv, ResearchGate, Zenodo — no affiliation required)
* **Workshops / conferences** (AI/ML-related or systems-focused)
* **Medium-tier ML venues** (Springer AI & Applications, etc.)
