Absolutely! **Defensive programming** is all about writing code that **anticipates potential problems** and guards against them proactively. It aims to make software more **robust**, **predictable**, and **secure** by handling unexpected or incorrect usage gracefully.

Hereâ€™s a list of common **defensive programming patterns**, along with brief explanations:

## **Defensive Programming Patterns**

| Pattern Name                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fail-Fast**                 | Detects and reports errors immediately to prevent further damage.           |
| **Fail-Safe**                 | Continues operation despite failures, often with degraded functionality.    |
| **Input Validation**          | Verifies inputs (e.g., non-null, format, range) before processing.          |
| **Assertions**                | Checks for conditions that should never happen (mostly in dev/test).        |
| **Guard Clauses**             | Early returns or checks to prevent bad states or inputs from proceeding.    |
| **Null Checks / Null Object** | Avoid `NullPointerException` by checking or using a default implementation. |
| **Immutability**              | Prevents accidental state changes by making objects immutable.              |
| **Encapsulation**            | Keeps internal state private to prevent external corruption.                |
| **Use of Exceptions**         | Throws meaningful exceptions when things go wrong (not silent failures).    |
| **Whitelisting over Blacklisting** | Accept only known good values, rather than blocking known bad ones.    |
| **Time-outs / Circuit Breakers** | Avoid hangs or infinite waits in distributed systems.                |
| **Retry Pattern**             | Retries failed operations under controlled conditions.                      |
| **Rate Limiting / Throttling**| Prevents resource exhaustion or abuse of services.                         |
| **Validation Annotations (Spring)** | Use of `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, etc., for automatic validation.        |
| **Logging & Monitoring**      | Ensures traceability of issues, aids quick diagnosis.                      |
| **Failover**                  | Uses backup components or data when a primary one fails.                    |
| **Use of Default Values**     | Provides defaults to avoid empty or missing values.                        |

## **Design Patterns Often Used for Defensive Programming**

| Pattern               | How it Helps Defensively                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Null Object Pattern** | Replaces `null` with a safe default behavior.            |
| **Decorator Pattern**   | Adds validation or error-handling behavior dynamically. |
| **Proxy Pattern**       | Intercepts access to add logging, security, or caching. |
| **Template Method**     | Ensures controlled execution steps with error hooks.    |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Modular and graceful handling of validations/errors. |
| **Builder Pattern**     | Builds objects safely with complete required fields.    |
