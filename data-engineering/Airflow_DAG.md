### **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Apache Airflow**

In **Apache Airflow**, a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a **collection of tasks** that are organized and executed in a specific order, forming a workflow. The **DAG** ensures tasks execute in a **logical sequence** without any cyclic dependencies.

---

### **What is a DAG in Airflow?**

- A **DAG** in Airflow is a **workflow definition** that:
  - Represents the **order of execution** for tasks.
  - Ensures no cyclic dependencies exist (it’s acyclic).
  - Executes tasks **based on scheduling** or manual triggers.

- **Key Components of a DAG**:
  - **Tasks**: Individual units of work (e.g., Python function, shell command, SQL query).
  - **Dependencies**: Define how tasks depend on each other (e.g., `Task B` must run after `Task A`).

### **Creating a DAG in Airflow**

A DAG in Airflow is defined in Python using the `DAG` class and operators to specify tasks.

#### **Basic Example**
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define a Python function
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, Airflow!")

# Define the DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id="example_dag",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),  # Schedule start date
    schedule_interval="@daily",       # Run every day
    catchup=False                     # Do not backfill for missed runs
) as dag:
    
    # Define tasks
    task_1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_1",
        python_callable=say_hello
    )

    task_2 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_2",
        python_callable=lambda: print("This is task 2!")
    )

    # Define dependencies
    task_1 >> task_2  # Task 1 runs before Task 2
```

### **Key Features of a DAG**

1. **Directed**: Tasks are executed in the order specified by dependencies.
2. **Acyclic**: No task can depend on itself (directly or indirectly).
3. **Graph**: The workflow is represented as a graph structure.

---

### **Components of an Airflow DAG**

#### 1. **DAG Arguments**
- **`dag_id`**: Unique identifier for the DAG.
- **`start_date`**: The date from which the DAG starts running.
- **`schedule_interval`**: Frequency of execution (e.g., `@daily`, `@hourly`, `cron` expressions).
- **`catchup`**: Whether to backfill for missed runs.
- **`default_args`**: Default parameters for all tasks in the DAG.

#### 2. **Tasks**
Tasks are individual operations in the DAG and are defined using **operators**:
- **PythonOperator**: Executes Python functions.
- **BashOperator**: Runs shell commands.
- **SQL operators**: Executes SQL queries.

#### 3. **Dependencies**
- Defined using `>>` (set downstream) or `<<` (set upstream) operators.
- Example:
  ```python
  task_1 >> task_2  # task_1 runs before task_2
  task_2 << task_3  # task_3 runs before task_2
  ```

---

### **DAG Execution Workflow**

1. **DAG Parsing**:
   - The DAG file is read by the Airflow scheduler.
   - Dependencies are analyzed to form the DAG structure.

2. **Task Scheduling**:
   - The scheduler decides which tasks can run based on dependencies and task states.
   - Tasks are queued for execution.

3. **Task Execution**:
   - Tasks are executed by Airflow workers.
   - The progress and status of each task are logged.

---

### **Airflow DAG Example with Multiple Tasks**

Here’s a more complex example with multiple tasks and dependencies:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define Python functions for tasks
def extract_data():
    print("Extracting data...")

def transform_data():
    print("Transforming data...")

def load_data():
    print("Loading data...")

# Define the DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id="etl_pipeline",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval="@daily",
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    # Define tasks
    extract = PythonOperator(
        task_id="extract_data",
        python_callable=extract_data
    )

    transform = PythonOperator(
        task_id="transform_data",
        python_callable=transform_data
    )

    load = PythonOperator(
        task_id="load_data",
        python_callable=load_data
    )

    # Set dependencies
    extract >> transform >> load
```

### **Visualizing DAGs**

You can view DAGs in the **Airflow Web UI**:
1. Open the Airflow UI (default: `http://localhost:8080`).
2. Navigate to the **DAGs** tab.
3. Click on your DAG to view the graph representation, task details, and logs.

---

### **Benefits of DAGs in Airflow**

1. **Task Orchestration**:
   - Automates workflows with clear dependencies.
2. **Modularity**:
   - Tasks are reusable and can be modified independently.
3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Failed tasks can be retried based on configured policies.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Workflows can scale to handle large data pipelines.

---

### **Common Use Cases for DAGs in Airflow**

1. **ETL Pipelines**:
   - Extract, transform, and load data across systems.
2. **Data Validation**:
   - Run quality checks on data pipelines.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Automate machine learning workflows.
4. **Report Generation**:
   - Schedule automated reports.
