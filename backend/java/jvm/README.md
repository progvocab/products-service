The **top 3 most used JVMs** today are:

---

#   1. **HotSpot JVM** (Oracle / OpenJDK)

* **Most common JVM** (used by Java SE, OpenJDK, Oracle JDK).
* Has **interpreter + JIT compilers (C1 & C2)** â†’ tiered compilation.
* **Focus:** General-purpose, balanced performance.
* **Used in:** Most Java apps (Spring Boot, Hadoop, Kafka, etc.).

---

#   2. **GraalVM**

* Newer high-performance JVM.
* Includes **Graal JIT compiler** (replaces C2 with a more advanced compiler).
* Supports **polyglot runtime** â†’ run Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, WebAssembly on the same VM.
* **Focus:** High-performance + multi-language interoperability.
* **Extra:** Can compile Java to **native executables** (AOT) with **Substrate VM**.

---

#   3. **Eclipse OpenJ9** (IBM)

* Lightweight, highly optimized JVM.
* **Lower memory footprint** vs HotSpot.
* Uses **JIT + Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation aggressively.
* **Focus:** Cloud, containers, resource-constrained environments.
* **Used in:** IBM products, enterprise apps running on limited-memory servers.

# ðŸ”¹ Key Differences at a Glance

| JVM         | Focus Area                    | Key Difference                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HotSpot** | General-purpose, standard JVM | Balanced interpreter + JIT (C1/C2), default in OpenJDK           |
| **GraalVM** | High performance & polyglot   | Advanced Graal JIT, supports multiple languages, AOT compilation |
| **OpenJ9**  | Cloud & low-memory efficiency | Small memory footprint, aggressive AOT, good for containers      |

âœ… Usage:

* Use **HotSpot** â†’ if you want the **standard, most tested JVM**.
* Use **GraalVM** â†’ if you need **performance** or **polyglot** support.
* Use **OpenJ9** â†’ if you want **low memory usage** in cloud/container setups.
