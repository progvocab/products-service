# Java

* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
  The engine that actually executes Java bytecode — it loads class files, verifies them, manages memory (heap, stack), and performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**
  A **package** that provides everything needed to run Java programs — it includes the **JVM**, **core libraries**, and **runtime files**, but **not** development tools (like `javac`).



> **JVM** = Execution engine
> **JRE** = JVM + Libraries (to *run* Java)
> **JDK** = JRE + Compiler & Tools (to *develop* Java)
