### 🌳 What is an **R-Tree**?

An **R-tree** (short for **Rectangle-tree** or **Region-tree**) is a **height-balanced tree data structure** used for indexing **multi-dimensional spatial data**, such as:

* Geographical coordinates
* Rectangles or polygons in 2D or 3D
* Bounding boxes in computer graphics, games, or image processing

> R-trees are especially useful in spatial databases and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for **efficient range queries, nearest neighbors**, and **overlap searches**.

### 📦 Core Idea

Each node in an R-tree stores a **minimum bounding rectangle (MBR)** that **completely contains** the MBRs of its children.

* **Leaf Nodes** contain entries like:

  ```
  (MBR, object_pointer)
  ```
* **Non-Leaf Nodes** contain entries like:

  ```
  (MBR, child_pointer)
  ```

### 📚 Structure Overview

* Similar to a B-tree, but with **multi-dimensional rectangles** instead of keys.
* The tree remains **balanced**.
* Insertion may cause **node splits**, which adjust the tree to maintain balance.

### 🔍 Visualization (2D Example)

Suppose you have spatial data (points/rectangles). The R-tree groups nearby objects into rectangles:

```
Root
 ├── MBR1 (contains several rectangles)
 │    ├── MBR1.1
 │    └── MBR1.2
 └── MBR2
      └── MBR2.1
```

Each MBR is the **smallest rectangle** that covers its child entries.

### ✅ Operations and Their Time Complexities

| Operation | Description                  | Time (avg case) |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| `Insert`  | Insert new spatial object    | `O(log n)`      |
| `Delete`  | Remove a spatial object      | `O(log n)`      |
| `Search`  | Range or intersection search | `O(log n + k)`  |
| `Nearest` | Nearest neighbor queries     | `O(log n)`      |

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle)**: A rectangle that tightly wraps an object.
* **Overlap**: Internal MBRs may overlap, unlike in B-trees.
* **Split Heuristic**: How to split a node when it's full (minimize area or overlap).
* **Choose Subtree**: Insert objects in the child whose MBR needs the **least enlargement**.

### 🛠 Python Example (Using `rtree` library)

Install:

```bash
pip install rtree
```

```python
from rtree import index

# Create an R-tree index
idx = index.Index()

# Insert items: (id, (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), obj)
idx.insert(0, (0, 0, 2, 2), obj="Square A")
idx.insert(1, (1, 1, 3, 3), obj="Square B")
idx.insert(2, (4, 4, 5, 5), obj="Square C")

# Search for overlaps with a region
results = list(idx.intersection((1.5, 1.5, 4.5, 4.5), objects=True))
for r in results:
    print(r.object)  # Prints objects intersecting the query rectangle
```

### 🆚 R-Tree vs Other Spatial Structures

| Data Structure                      | Use Case                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **R-Tree**                          | Spatial indexing of rectangles, MBRs  |
| **KD-Tree**                         | Point-based multi-dimensional queries |
| **Quad Tree**                       | Recursive 2D space partitioning       |
| **Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)** | Used in graphics and physics engines  |
