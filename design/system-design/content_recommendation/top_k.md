“**Top-K**” is a common term in recommendation systems and ranking tasks. Let me explain carefully:

---

## **1. Definition**

* **Top-K** refers to the **K highest-ranked items** for a user according to a scoring or ranking function.

* In a recommendation system, this means:

  > "The K items most likely to interest this user."

* For example, if a model predicts scores for 1,000 movies for a user, the **top 10 movies** with the highest scores are the **Top-10 recommendations**.

---

## **2. Why Top-K is Used**

1. **Practicality**:

   * Users are not shown hundreds or thousands of items at once. Only the **most relevant K items** are displayed.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**:

   * Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG@K measure how good the **Top-K items** are.
3. **Performance**:

   * Computing Top-K allows you to focus on the **most important items** without storing or ranking all items.

---

## **3. Example**

Suppose your recommendation model predicts scores for a user:

| Item    | Score |
| ------- | ----- |
| Movie A | 0.9   |
| Movie B | 0.75  |
| Movie C | 0.6   |
| Movie D | 0.4   |

* If **K = 2**, the **Top-2 items** are **Movie A** and **Movie B**.
* These are the items you would show to the user in the UI.

---

## **4. In Our Airflow DAG**

* After `train_model()` we predict scores for all items.
* We **sort items by score for each user** and pick the **Top-K** to store in the `recommendation` table.
* The API then returns these **precomputed Top-K recommendations** for fast serving.

---

✅ **Summary**

* **Top-K = the K highest-scoring items** for a user.
* It’s central to **recommendation systems**, both for **displaying recommendations** and **evaluating model accuracy**.
* Typical values: K = 5, 10, 20 depending on UI and application.

If you want, I can also explain **how Top-K is used in ranking metrics like NDCG@K and Precision@K**, to connect it with **model evaluation**.

Do you want me to do that?
