This is a broad and deep topic, because **transformations** show up in math, stats, ML, and algorithms. Letâ€™s organize it so you get a **map of the different types**.

# ðŸ”¹ What is a Transformation?

A **transformation** is simply a function that maps data/objects from one space to another, often to simplify analysis, computation, or representation.

Formally:

$$
T : X \to Y, \quad y = T(x)
$$

Depending on properties of $T$, we classify transformations differently.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 1. **Linear Transformations**

* Definition: preserves **addition** and **scalar multiplication**:

$$
T(ax + by) = aT(x) + bT(y)
$$

* Examples:

  * Matrix multiplication ($y = Ax$)
  * Scaling, rotation, reflection, projection
* Used in: linear algebra, graphics, PCA, neural nets (linear layers).

---

# ðŸ”¹ 2. **Affine Transformations**

* Linear + translation:

$$
T(x) = Ax + b
$$

* Preserves straight lines but not the origin.
* Examples: scaling, rotation, translation in computer graphics.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 3. **Monotonic Transformations**

* Function that preserves order:

$$
x_1 < x_2 \implies f(x_1) < f(x_2) \quad (\text{increasing})
$$

or

$$
x_1 < x_2 \implies f(x_1) > f(x_2) \quad (\text{decreasing})
$$

* Examples:

  * Log, exponential, square root
  * Normalization in stats (rank-preserving)
* Used in: statistics (e.g., monotonic link functions), economics (utility functions).

---

# ðŸ”¹ 4. **Nonlinear Transformations**

* Anything not linear.
* Examples: polynomial ($x^2$), logarithmic, sigmoid, tanh.
* Used in: machine learning (activations), feature engineering.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 5. **Orthogonal / Isometric Transformations**

* Preserve distances and angles.
* Examples:

  * Rotation matrices
  * Reflections
* Used in: computer graphics, preserving geometric structure.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 6. **Fourier / Spectral Transformations**

* Convert data from one domain â†’ frequency domain.
* Examples:

  * Fourier Transform
  * Laplace Transform
  * Wavelet Transform
* Used in: signal processing, physics, ML feature extraction.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 7. **Logarithmic / Power Transformations (Statistical)**

* Reduce skewness, stabilize variance.
* Examples:

  * $y = \log(x)$
  * $y = \sqrt{x}$
  * Boxâ€“Cox transform
* Used in: regression, econometrics.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 8. **Probability & Distribution Transformations**

* Change random variables while preserving probability mass.
* Examples:

  * CDF transforms (Inverse Transform Sampling)
  * Normalization: $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$
  * Copula transformations in multivariate stats

---

# ðŸ”¹ 9. **Monotonic Stack / Order-Preserving Transforms**

* In algorithms, monotonic transformations are applied to maintain ordered structures (like min/max stacks).

---

# ðŸ”¹ 10. **Nonlinear Geometric Transformations**

* Warp coordinates (not preserving linearity).
* Examples:

  * Perspective projection
  * Distortions in images
  * Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP)

---

# ðŸ”¹ 11. **Group & Symmetry Transformations**

* From abstract algebra: transformation that preserves group structure.
* Examples:

  * Rotations (SO(3))
  * Lorentz transformations in relativity

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also **connect this to neural networks**, i.e. how different transformations (linear, nonlinear, monotonic) are combined in layers to make models universal approximators?
