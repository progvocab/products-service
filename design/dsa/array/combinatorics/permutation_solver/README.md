 a **permutation solver** usually means an algorithm (or tool) that finds the sequence of operations needed to transform a given permutation into the **identity permutation** (i.e., sorted order).

Different contexts exist depending on what operations are allowed:

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Permutation Solvers

1. **Cycle decomposition solver**

   * Any permutation can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles.
   * From cycle decomposition, you can derive:

     * **Minimum number of swaps** to sort = $n - (\text{# of cycles})$.
   * Example: permutation `[1,0,2]` â†’ cycles `(0 1)(2)` â†’ needs **1 swap**.

---

2. **Sorting by adjacent swaps (inversions)**

   * In this model, the solver counts **inversions**.
   * Minimum adjacent swaps = number of inversions.
   * Example: `[3,1,2]` has 2 inversions â†’ needs **2 adjacent swaps**.

---

3. **Prefix reversal solver (Pancake sorting)**

   * Allowed operation: flip a prefix.
   * Any permutation can be sorted in â‰¤ `2n - 3` flips.
   * There are algorithms that minimize the number of flips.

---

4. **Block reversals (genome rearrangement)**

   * More advanced solvers study sorting a permutation by reversing *any* segment (used in computational biology).
   * Known as **sorting by reversals problem**.

---

5. **General permutation solvers (group theory)**

   * In abstract algebra, a permutation solver finds a decomposition into **generators** (like transpositions or adjacent swaps).
   * Example: Rubikâ€™s Cube solvers are essentially **permutation solvers** in a special group.

âœ… So depending on the allowed operations (swap, rotate, reverse, prefix-reverse), the permutation solver gives you the **minimal sequence of moves** to reach sorted order.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **build a permutation solver in Python** that, given an array and allowed operations (swap / reverse / rotate / prefix-reverse), returns the minimum steps + actual moves?
