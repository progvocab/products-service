The **difference** is in *what “connected” means* and *how Union–Find applies* to **directed** vs **undirected** graphs.

---

## **1. In an Undirected Graph**

* **Connected** means: there’s *any* path between two vertices, ignoring direction.
* **Disjoint set** (Union–Find) works perfectly:

  * For each edge `(u, v)`, we union `u` and `v`.
  * After processing all edges, each set = one connected component.
* **Cycle detection**: If `u` and `v` are already in the same set before adding an edge, there’s a cycle.

**Example**
Graph:

```
1 -- 2    3 -- 4
```

Edges: `(1, 2), (3, 4)`
Final sets: `{1, 2}`, `{3, 4}`

---

## **2. In a Directed Graph**

* **Connected** can mean two different things:

  1. **Weak connectivity** (ignore edge direction, same as undirected)
  2. **Strong connectivity** (a path exists both ways between vertices)
* **Union–Find works only for *weak connectivity***, because it ignores edge direction.

  * If you want **strongly connected components (SCCs)**, you need algorithms like **Kosaraju** or **Tarjan** — Union–Find alone won’t capture direction.

**Example** (weak connectivity with Union–Find)

```
1 → 2    3 → 4
```

Edges: `(1, 2), (3, 4)`
Treating as undirected for weak connectivity:

* `{1, 2}`, `{3, 4}`

But strongly:

* `{1, 2}` are **not** strongly connected (1→2 exists, but 2→1 doesn’t).

---

## **3. Cycle Detection Difference**

* **Undirected**: Union–Find is enough — if both vertices already in the same set, cycle exists.
* **Directed**: Union–Find doesn’t detect cycles correctly, because direction matters.

  * Example: `1 → 2 → 3 → 1`
    Union–Find would merge all into one set without realizing the direction formed a cycle.
  * For directed cycle detection, you use **DFS with recursion stack** or **Kahn’s topological sort**.

## **Key Summary Table**

| Feature                  | Undirected Graph             | Directed Graph                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Connectivity Meaning     | Path in any direction        | Weak (ignore direction) or Strong (both ways) |
| Union–Find Works?        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ For weak connectivity only                  |
| Cycle Detection with DSU | ✅ Works                      | ❌ Doesn’t work (use DFS/toposort)             |
| Strong Connectivity      | Trivial with DSU (all edges) | ❌ Need Tarjan/Kosaraju                        |

If you want, I can make a **side-by-side visual diagram** showing how the same edges produce different disjoint sets in **directed vs undirected** cases.
That would make the difference click instantly.

Do you want me to draw that?
