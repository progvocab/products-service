Good question ðŸš€ â€” querying an **agent** is slightly different from just calling an LLM.
Because an **agent** is more than just the model â€” itâ€™s an **LLM + runtime + MCPs + prompts + tools/memory**.

Letâ€™s break it down:

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Query an Agent

### 1. **Direct Prompt Query**

If the agent is a thin wrapper around the LLM:

* You send a **user query** (natural language request).
* The agent applies its **system + instruction prompts**, retrieves any context, injects MCPs, and then calls the LLM.

**Example (Python-like pseudo-code):**

```python
response = agent.query("Summarize the Q2 financial results in 3 bullet points")
print(response)
```

---

### 2. **API Call (Agent as Service)**

If the agent is deployed as a **microservice** (REST/gRPC):

* You send a request (usually JSON).
* The agent processes it and returns structured output.

**Example (REST API):**

```bash
POST /agent/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_input": "Generate SQL query for all employees in HR department",
  "context": "Table: employees(id, name, dept)"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept = 'HR';"
}
```

### 3. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**

If multiple agents exist (e.g., Research Agent, SQL Agent, Summarizer Agent):

* You query the **Orchestrator**.
* It routes your request to the correct agent(s).
* Agents might collaborate via tool calls or message passing.

**Example:**

```yaml
query: "Find the top 5 products by revenue and explain the results in plain English"
agents:
  - retriever: fetches sales data
  - sql_generator: builds SQL query
  - explainer: summarizes results
```

---

### 4. **Interactive Query (Chat Session)**

Agents often keep **state/memory**, so you query them in a conversational way:

```text
User: Show me last month's sales.
Agent: Total sales were $4.2M across 3 regions.
User: Break it down by product.
Agent: Product A: $2M, Product B: $1.2M, Product C: $1M.
```

## ðŸ”¹ What Happens Under the Hood

When you query an agent:

1. **Input â†’ User Query**
2. **Agent Processing**

   * Injects system + context prompts
   * Fetches relevant documents (RAG)
   * Adjusts MCPs (temperature, top-p, etc.)
3. **LLM Call**

   * Actual reasoning/generation
4. **Post-Processing**

   * Validation, formatting, tool calls
5. **Output â†’ Structured Response**

---

âœ… **In short:**
You query an agent by sending it **natural language or structured requests**.
The agent takes care of applying **prompts, MCPs, memory, and tools** before passing it to the LLM, and then returns a structured or conversational response.
