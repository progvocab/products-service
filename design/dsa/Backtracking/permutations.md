Perfect question 👍 — these four notations are central in **permutations and combinations**. Let’s go through them one by one, step by step, with definitions, formulas, and examples.

---

# 🔹 1. **Factorial ( $n!$ )**

* Definition:

$$
n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1
$$

* Meaning: Total number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct items in a sequence.
* Example:

$$
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
$$

So, there are **120 ways** to arrange 5 people in a line.

---

# 🔹 2. **$c^n$ (Choices with Replacement)**

* If you have **c choices** for each position, and you need to make $n$ decisions **with repetition allowed**, then:

$$
\text{Total ways} = c^n
$$

* Example:
  Flip a coin ($c = 2$, heads/tails) 3 times ($n = 3$):

$$
2^3 = 8 \quad \text{possible outcomes}
$$

---

# 🔹 3. **Combinations ($nCr$)**

* Choosing **r items out of n**, order **doesn’t matter**.
* Formula:

$$
^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

* Example:
  Choose 2 fruits out of 4 (apple, banana, cherry, date):

$$
^4C_2 = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot (4-2)!} = \frac{24}{2 \cdot 2} = 6
$$

So there are 6 possible fruit pairs.

---

# 🔹 4. **Permutations ($nPr$)**

* Choosing **r items out of n**, order **does matter**.
* Formula:

$$
^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

* Example:
  Arrange 2 out of 4 students in a line:

$$
^4P_2 = \frac{4!}{(4-2)!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
$$

So there are 12 possible ordered arrangements.

| $c^n$    | $c^n$                                  | Sequences of length $n$ with $c$ choices each (repetition allowed) | $2^3 = 8$ outcomes of 3 coin tosses |
| $nCr$    | $\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$                 | Ways to **choose** $r$ from $n$, order doesn’t matter              | $4C2 = 6$ fruit pairs               |
| $nPr$    | $\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}$                   | Ways to **arrange** $r$ from $n$, order matters                    | $4P2 = 12$ student lineups          |

👉 Would you like me to also show you a **Python snippet** that calculates all four ($n!$, $c^n$, $nCr$, $nPr$) so you can play with values interactively?



Great! Let's walk through **a simple problem using backtracking** for both **combinations** and **permutations**, similar in spirit to what we just did earlier.

---

## ✅ Problem 1: **Generate all combinations of k numbers out of 1 to n**

### ✨ Example:

Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
Output:

```
[ [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4] ]
```

### 🔁 Backtracking Logic:

* At each step, choose a number and move forward.
* Stop when length `k` is reached.
* Use pruning to skip numbers already used or out of bounds.

### 🧠 Time Complexity:

Roughly `O(C(n, k))` – number of combinations.

### ✅ Code in Python:

```python
def combine(n, k):
    result = []

    def backtrack(start, path):
        if len(path) == k:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(start, n + 1):
            path.append(i)
            backtrack(i + 1, path)
            path.pop()  # backtrack

    backtrack(1, [])
    return result

print(combine(4, 2))
```

---

## ✅ Problem 2: **Generate all permutations of a list**

### ✨ Example:

Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
Output:

```
[ [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1] ]
```

### 🔁 Backtracking Logic:

* At each step, pick a number that hasn't been used yet.
* Track used numbers via a boolean array or in-place swapping.

### 🧠 Time Complexity:

`O(n!)` – number of permutations.

### ✅ Code in Python:

```python
def permute(nums):
    result = []
    used = [False] * len(nums)

    def backtrack(path):
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if not used[i]:
                used[i] = True
                path.append(nums[i])
                backtrack(path)
                path.pop()
                used[i] = False

    backtrack([])
    return result

print(permute([1, 2, 3]))
```

Would you like to explore these with constraints (like duplicate handling, sum limits, etc.) next?


To generate **all permutations** for a 3-digit **suitcase lock** using digits from `0` to `9`, where **each digit can be reused**, you're essentially solving a **permutation with repetition** problem.

### ✅ Problem:

* Lock has 3 digits.
* Each digit can be from `0` to `9`.
* Total combinations: $10^3 = 1000$
* Use **backtracking** to generate all.

---

### 🧠 Backtracking Strategy:

Each "decision" is placing a digit (0–9) at a position in the lock.
Backtrack when the current combination has 3 digits.

---

### 🔢 Python Code (Backtracking):

```python
def generate_lock_combinations():
    digits = [str(i) for i in range(10)]
    result = []

    def backtrack(path):
        if len(path) == 3:
            result.append("".join(path))
            return
        for d in digits:
            path.append(d)
            backtrack(path)
            path.pop()  # undo last choice

    backtrack([])
    return result

# Example usage:
combinations = generate_lock_combinations()
print("Total combinations:", len(combinations))
print("First 10 combinations:", combinations[:10])
```

---

### 🧾 Output Example:

```
Total combinations: 1000
First 10 combinations: ['000', '001', '002', '003', '004', '005', '006', '007', '008', '009']
```

---

### 🧠 Notes:

* This is not a permutation of **distinct digits**, so repetition is allowed.
* If **no repetition** was allowed, we’d use a different approach (`itertools.permutations` or visited flags).
* Backtracking is overkill here since it's just base-10 enumeration, but it's a good exercise.

Would you like a version where **digits must be unique (no repeats)** or support for **n-digit locks**?
