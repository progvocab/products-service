Thank you! Now the problem is clearer.

### üß© **Problem Statement (Formalized)**

You're given:

* A list `nums` of **distinct integers**
* An integer `k` (length of a subarray)

In **one operation**, you can:

* Select **any subarray of length `k`**
* Replace **all its elements** with the **maximum** of that subarray

Your goal is:

> **Minimize** the number of operations such that `nums[0] == nums[-1]` (i.e., `nums[1] == nums[n]` in 1-indexed form)

---

### üß† Key Observations

* After each operation, some elements become **equal to the maximum** in that subarray.
* The number of **distinct values decreases**, and values "spread" toward the maximum.
* We want to **propagate** the value from `nums[0]` or `nums[-1]` until both become equal.

---

### ‚úÖ Strategy

We simulate the process by **spreading** the max value using a **sliding window of size `k`**, and count the number of operations until `nums[0] == nums[-1]`.

---

### üêç Python Implementation

```python
def min_operations(nums, k):
    from collections import deque

    n = len(nums)
    ops = 0

    while nums[0] != nums[-1]:
        changed = False
        i = 0
        while i + k <= n:
            sub = nums[i:i + k]
            max_val = max(sub)
            if any(x != max_val for x in sub):
                nums[i:i + k] = [max_val] * k
                changed = True
                ops += 1
                break  # Only one operation allowed per step
            i += 1
        if not changed:
            break  # No more progress possible
    return ops

# üß™ Example:
nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]
k = 2
print(min_operations(nums, k))  # Output: number of steps to make nums[0] == nums[-1]
```

### üîÑ Example Walkthrough

Let‚Äôs say:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
```

* First operation: select `[3, 4]` ‚Üí becomes `[4, 4]`
* Then `[2, 4]` ‚Üí `[4, 4]`
* Eventually, `[1, 4]` ‚Üí `[4, 4]`

Final array: `[4, 4, 4, 4]` ‚Üí `nums[0] == nums[-1]` ‚úÖ

Let me know if you'd like a version that **minimizes all values to match `nums[0]`** or **visualizes each step**.

The problem you described ‚Äî where you apply operations to subarrays to make the first and last elements equal ‚Äî belongs to the class of **greedy + simulation** problems, and has connections with:

| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Greedy Algorithms**                                | You are making a "local optimal choice" at each step by selecting a subarray and replacing it with its max value ‚Äî trying to minimize total steps. |
| **Simulation Problems**                              | You are simulating each step exactly as described, updating the array, and counting the steps needed to reach the goal.                            |
| **Sliding Window / Subarray**                        | You work with **subarrays of fixed length `k`**, often using a **sliding window** technique to examine all possible operations.                    |
| **Transformation / Convergence Problems**            | The array is transformed step-by-step to **converge** to a state where `nums[0] == nums[-1]`.                                                      |
| **Graph-like Propagation** (optional interpretation) | The value from the max elements "spreads" through the array like information or influence ‚Äî similar to BFS or contagion in graphs.                 |
