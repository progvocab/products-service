In the coin change problem, a greedy algorithm might not always find the optimal solution (minimum number of coins), while dynamic programming guarantees an optimal solution for any coin denominations. Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices, while dynamic programming considers all possible combinations to find the global optimum. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]  
Dynamic Programming: 

• Approach: Dynamic programming solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. [1, 1, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
• Algorithm: It typically involves creating a table (e.g., a 1D or 2D array) to store the minimum number of coins needed to make change for each amount from 0 to the target amount. [6, 6]  
• Example: Consider coins with denominations and a target amount of 6. Dynamic programming would consider all possible combinations of these coins and store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount (0 to 6). [1, 1, 3, 3, 11, 11]  
• Optimal Solution: It guarantees the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the target amount. [1, 1, 2, 2, 12, 13]  
• Time Complexity: O(n*amount), where n is the number of coin denominations and amount is the target amount. [6, 6, 14, 14]  
• Space Complexity: O(amount) using a 1D array or O(n*amount) using a 2D array. [6, 6]  

Greedy Algorithm: 

• Approach: The greedy algorithm picks the largest coin denomination that's less than or equal to the remaining amount and repeats this process until the target amount is reached. [1, 1, 15, 15]  
• Example: For the same coins and target amount 6, the greedy algorithm would first pick 4, then 1, then 1, resulting in three coins. The optimal solution is two coins (3,3). [1, 1, 3, 3, 11, 11]  
• Not Always Optimal: The greedy algorithm may not find the optimal solution for all coin denomination sets. For example, with coins and a target of 12, the greedy algorithm would pick, but the optimal solution is. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 16, 16, 17, 17]  
• Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of coin denominations. [1, 1, 6, 6]  
• Space Complexity: O(1) (constant space). [1, 1]  

In Summary: 

• Dynamic Programming: Guarantees the optimal solution, but has a higher time and space complexity. [1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 18, 19, 20]  
• Greedy Algorithm: Faster and simpler to implement, but may not always find the optimal solution. It only works for certain coin denominations (e.g., standard currency systems). [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 21, 22]
