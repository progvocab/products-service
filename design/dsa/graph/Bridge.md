Sure! Let's understand **bridges** and **articulation points** in a graph — two fundamental concepts in graph theory, especially useful in **network design**, **connectivity analysis**, and **fault tolerance**.

## 🔹 1. Bridge (Cut-edge)

### **Definition:**

A **bridge** is an edge in a graph whose **removal increases the number of connected components**. In simpler terms, removing a bridge **disconnects** the graph.

### ✅ Example:

```
A --- B --- C
      |
      D
```

* Edge `B—C` is a **bridge**.
* If we remove it, `C` becomes **disconnected** from the rest of the graph.

### 🧠 Use case:

* In networks, bridges represent **critical connections**.
* Failure of a bridge link causes **network partition**.

## 🔹 2. Articulation Point (Cut-vertex)

### **Definition:**

An **articulation point** is a vertex whose **removal increases the number of connected components** — meaning it **disconnects** part of the graph.

### ✅ Example:

```
A --- B --- C
      |
      D
```

* Node `B` is an **articulation point**.
* If `B` is removed:

  * `A`, `C`, and `D` get **disconnected** from each other.

### 🧠 Use case:

* In a communication network, articulation points are **single points of failure**.

## 🔧 How to Find Bridges and Articulation Points

You can use **DFS (Depth First Search)** with the following key ideas:

* Track **discovery time** and **low time** for each node.
* A node `u` is an **articulation point** if:

  * `u` is the root and has ≥ 2 children, or
  * for any child `v`, `low[v] ≥ disc[u]`
* An edge `(u, v)` is a **bridge** if:

  * `low[v] > disc[u]`

## 🔍 Python Code Example (Using DFS)

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, V):
        self.V = V
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
        self.time = 0

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)
        self.graph[v].append(u)

    def dfs(self, u, visited, disc, low, parent, ap, bridges):
        children = 0
        visited[u] = True
        disc[u] = low[u] = self.time
        self.time += 1

        for v in self.graph[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                children += 1
                self.dfs(v, visited, disc, low, u, ap, bridges)
                low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                # Articulation point condition
                if parent[u] is None and children > 1:
                    ap[u] = True
                if parent[u] is not None and low[v] >= disc[u]:
                    ap[u] = True

                # Bridge condition
                if low[v] > disc[u]:
                    bridges.append((u, v))
            elif v != parent[u]:
                low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

    def find_ap_and_bridges(self):
        visited = [False] * self.V
        disc = [float('inf')] * self.V
        low = [float('inf')] * self.V
        parent = [None] * self.V
        ap = [False] * self.V
        bridges = []

        for i in range(self.V):
            if not visited[i]:
                self.dfs(i, visited, disc, low, parent, ap, bridges)

        articulation_points = [i for i, is_ap in enumerate(ap) if is_ap]
        return articulation_points, bridges


# Example usage
g = Graph(5)
g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.add_edge(1, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 3)
g.add_edge(3, 4)

aps, bridges = g.find_ap_and_bridges()
print("Articulation Points:", aps)
print("Bridges:", bridges)
```

### Output:

```
Articulation Points: [1, 3]
Bridges: [(3, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (0, 1)]
```
