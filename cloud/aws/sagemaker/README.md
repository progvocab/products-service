Here’s a **clear 15-line overview of Amazon SageMaker features**, focused on what’s actually used in practice:

1. **SageMaker Studio** – Web-based IDE for building, training, and deploying ML models.
2. **Built-in Algorithms** – Optimized algorithms for XGBoost, Linear Learner, K-Means, PCA, etc.
3. **Custom Training** – Train models using your own code in TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.
4. **Managed Training Jobs** – Automatically provisions, scales, and terminates training infrastructure.
5. **Distributed Training** – Supports data and model parallelism for large-scale training.
6. **Automatic Model Tuning** – Hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian search.
7. **SageMaker Pipelines** – End-to-end ML workflow orchestration (CI/CD for ML).
8. **Feature Store** – Centralized repository for storing, sharing, and reusing ML features.
9. **Model Registry** – Versioning, approval, and governance of trained models.
10. **Batch Transform** – Run offline inference on large datasets.
11. **Real-time Endpoints** – Low-latency model inference with auto-scaling.
12. **Serverless Inference** – Pay-per-request inference without managing servers.
13. **Monitoring & Drift Detection** – Detect data drift and model quality issues.
14. **Security & Compliance** – IAM, VPC isolation, encryption, and audit logging.
15. **Integration with AWS Stack** – Native integration with S3, Glue, Athena, Lambda, and CloudWatch.

### One-line summary (interview-ready)
