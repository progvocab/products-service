just like there are many transforms (Laplace, Fourier, etc.), in **Machine Learning** there are many **classifiers** (algorithms that assign input data to a class/label).

Let me give you a **comprehensive taxonomy of classifiers** with their families, intuition, and real-world use cases.

âœ… **Summary:**

* NaÃ¯ve Bayes is one of the simplest classifiers (probabilistic).
* But there are **linear, tree-based, distance-based, SVM, neural networks, and ensemble classifiers**.
* Choice depends on data type (text, image, sequence, tabular) and trade-off (accuracy vs interpretability vs speed).

Would you like me to also prepare a **Python code comparison** (e.g., scikit-learn examples) showing the same dataset classified with NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM side by side?
