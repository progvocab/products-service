Sure! Here's a list of key **Dependency Injection** and **Architectural Design Patterns**, categorized by purpose, with brief explanations.

## **I. Dependency Injection (DI) Design Patterns**

These patterns help manage object creation and decouple application components.

| Pattern                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Constructor Injection** | Dependencies are provided via constructor. Promotes immutability.         |
| **Setter Injection**      | Dependencies are set via public setters. Good for optional dependencies.   |
| **Field Injection**       | Dependencies injected directly into fields (less testable, used in Spring).|
| **Interface Injection**   | Dependency provides an injector interface which client implements. Rare.   |
| **Service Locator**       | Client asks a registry for a service. Decouples creation but not lookup.   |
| **Factory Pattern**       | Encapsulates object creation logic. Often used with DI.                    |
| **Abstract Factory**      | Provides interface for creating families of related objects.               |
| **Provider Pattern**      | Client receives a provider/factory and pulls the dependency when needed.   |

## **II. Architectural Design Patterns**

These define high-level structures of applications.

| Pattern                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layered (n-tier)**        | Application divided into layers (Controller → Service → DAO).               |
| **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** | Core logic isolated from external systems (UI, DB). Flexible and testable. |
| **Onion Architecture**      | Similar to hexagonal but with strict layering around core domain logic.     |
| **Microservices**           | Application split into independent services. Enables scalability and agility.|
| **Monolithic**              | Entire application is a single deployable unit. Simpler but less scalable.  |
| **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** | Services communicate over a network, often using ESBs. Predecessor to microservices. |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Components communicate via asynchronous events. Enables decoupling and reactivity. |
| **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** | Separates UI, logic, and data. Standard in Spring (Web MVC).              |
| **Client-Server**           | Clients communicate with a central server. Basis of most web architectures. |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Separate read and write models for better scalability. |
| **Proxy Pattern**           | Access to an object is controlled via a surrogate. Used for security, caching. |
| **Dependency Injection Container** | A framework handles object creation and wiring (like Spring).         |

## **III. Combined Usage in Frameworks like Spring Boot**

| Feature                      | Pattern(s) Used                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Autowired`, `@Inject`      | Constructor / Setter / Field Injection                                |
| `@Bean`                      | Factory / Provider Pattern                                             |
| `@ComponentScan`             | Service Locator (internally), IoC                                     |
| `ApplicationContext.getBean()` | Service Locator Pattern                                              |
| Spring Boot Autoconfiguration| Abstract Factory, Template, Proxy                                     |
| Microservice structure       | Layered, Microservices, Event-Driven                                   |
