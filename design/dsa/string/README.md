## 1. Longest Palindrome
---
```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    if not s:
        return ""
    
    start, end = 0, 0  # track longest palindrome bounds

    def expandAroundCenter(left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        # return bounds of palindrome (excluding overshoot)
        return left + 1, right - 1

    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Odd length palindrome
        l1, r1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i)
        # Even length palindrome
        l2, r2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)

        # choose longer
        if r1 - l1 > end - start:
            start, end = l1, r1
        if r2 - l2 > end - start:
            start, end = l2, r2

    return s[start:end + 1]


```

## 2. Longest Common Prefix 

```python 

def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Start with the first string as prefix
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for s in strs[1:]:
        # Reduce prefix until it matches the start of s
        while not s.startswith(prefix):
            prefix = prefix[:-1] # remove last character 
            if not prefix:
                return ""
    
    return prefix


# Example usage
print(longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"]))  # "fl"
print(longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"]))     # ""

```
---
## 3. Matching Bracket 

```python 

def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    # mapping of closing to opening
    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    stack = []

    for ch in s:
        if ch in mapping:  # if it's a closing bracket
            # pop from stack if not empty, else assign dummy
            top = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[ch] != top:
                return False
        else:
            # it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(ch)

    # valid only if stack is empty
    return not stack


```

## 4. Levenshtein Distance 
- Time: O(m × n)
- Space: O(m × n)
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 into word2.
Allowed operations:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character
```python
def minDistance(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(
                    dp[i - 1][j],     # delete
                    dp[i][j - 1],     # insert
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1]  # replace
                )

    return dp[m][n]

```

## 5. Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS).
- A subsequence is a sequence derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- Unlike substrings, subsequences don’t have to be contiguous.
```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)] # Dynamic Programming 2D array 

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]: # if character matches 
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1] # LCS is one more than previous 
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) #

    return dp[m][n]

```

## 6. **Minimum Window Substring**  
Given two strings s and t, find the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.

```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if not t or not s:
        return ""
    
    t_count = Counter(t)          # Count characters in t "abcabb" -> "a" :2 , "b":3 , "c" :1 
    window = {}
    
    have, need = 0, len(t_count)  # track when window is valid
    res, res_len = [-1, -1], float("inf")
    l = 0
    
    for r in range(len(s)):
        c = s[r]
        window[c] = window.get(c, 0) + 1
        
        if c in t_count and window[c] == t_count[c]:
            have += 1
        
        # Shrink window from left
        while have == need:
            # Update result if smaller window found
            if (r - l + 1) < res_len:
                res = [l, r]
                res_len = r - l + 1
            
            # Pop from left
            window[s[l]] -= 1
            if s[l] in t_count and window[s[l]] < t_count[s[l]]:
                have -= 1
            l += 1
    
    l, r = res
    return s[l:r+1] if res_len != float("inf") else ""

```
