Let’s go step by step — you’re mixing a few Fourier concepts with some common signal/shape cases.

## **1. Fourier Transform Basics Recap**

The Fourier Transform (FT) converts a function $f(x)$ from **time/space domain** to the **frequency domain**:

$$
F(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i k x} dx
$$

In algorithms (especially image processing, data compression, convolution acceleration), this is useful because operations in one domain often become simpler in the other.

## **2. Fourier of Gaussian**

A Gaussian function in space:

$$
g(x) = e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

Its Fourier Transform is also a Gaussian:

$$
G(k) = \sigma \sqrt{2\pi} \, e^{-2 \pi^2 \sigma^2 k^2}
$$

**Key property:** A Gaussian is its own Fourier pair (up to scaling). This is why Gaussian smoothing in space is equivalent to Gaussian filtering in frequency.

## **3. Fourier of Uniform Distribution (Rectangular Function)**

A uniform (box) function:

$$
u(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } |x| \leq a \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Its Fourier Transform is a **sinc** function:

$$
U(k) = 2a \, \text{sinc}(2\pi a k)
$$

**Key property:** Wide box in space → narrow sinc in frequency; narrow box → wide sinc.
This is the **time–bandwidth tradeoff**.

## **4. Fourier of Ellipsoid**

In **2D/3D**, an ellipsoid in space (uniform density inside) transforms into a **Bessel-type function** in frequency domain.
Example for a 2D ellipse with semi-axes $a, b$:

$$
F(k_x, k_y) \propto \frac{J_1(2\pi R)}{R}
$$

where $R = \sqrt{(a k_x)^2 + (b k_y)^2}$ and $J_1$ is a Bessel function.

**Use:** Shape analysis in computer vision, diffraction patterns in physics.

---

## **5. Fourier Shift Theorem**

If $f(x)$ has Fourier Transform $F(k)$, then shifting $f$ by $x_0$:

$$
f(x - x_0) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad e^{-2\pi i k x_0} F(k)
$$

**Meaning:** A shift in space multiplies the Fourier spectrum by a complex exponential — phase changes, magnitude unchanged.

**Use in algorithms:** Phase correlation for image alignment, watermarking.

## **6. Why These Matter in Algorithms**

* **Gaussian FT** → used in Gaussian blur, scale-space theory, and denoising.
* **Uniform FT** → explains diffraction patterns and sampling artifacts.
* **Ellipsoid FT** → used in tomography, shape recognition.
* **Shift theorem** → enables fast pattern matching in frequency space.

If you want, I can give you a **Python demo** where we take a Gaussian, uniform box, and ellipse, compute their Fourier transforms using NumPy, and visualize the patterns.
That will make these concepts much more intuitive.
