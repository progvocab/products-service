### âœ… API Gateway in Spring Cloud

In **Spring Cloud**, the API Gateway acts as a **single entry point** for routing requests to various microservices. It is typically implemented using **Spring Cloud Gateway**, which is a modern, reactive, and non-blocking API gateway built on **Spring WebFlux**.

---

## ðŸ§± What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a **system design pattern** that sits between the client and microservices. It handles:

* **Routing**
* **Security**
* **Rate limiting**
* **Load balancing**
* **Monitoring**
* **Aggregation**

> It simplifies the client interaction with a microservice architecture by abstracting service details.

## ðŸšª Spring Cloud Gateway Overview

**Spring Cloud Gateway** is the preferred API Gateway in the Spring ecosystem (replacing Netflix Zuul).

### ðŸ”§ Basic Setup:

Add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Basic config in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
```

## âœ¨ Main Features of Spring Cloud Gateway

| Feature                          | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing**                      | Routes requests to microservices based on path, header, method, etc.              |
| **Predicate-based Filtering**    | Supports conditional routing using predicates like `Path`, `Host`, `Method`, etc. |
| **Filters (Pre/Post)**           | Modify request/response (e.g., add headers, strip path, transform body)           |
| **Load Balancing**               | Integrates with **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** or **Eureka** for service discovery |
| **Path Rewriting**               | Easily rewrite incoming URLs                                                      |
| **Rate Limiting**                | Throttle clients using token bucket algorithm (via Redis)                         |
| **Circuit Breaker**              | Built-in support with **Resilience4j**                                            |
| **Authentication/Authorization** | Easily integrates with OAuth2 / JWT using Spring Security                         |
| **WebSocket support**            | Supports WebSocket proxying                                                       |
| **Reactive / Non-blocking**      | Built on Spring WebFlux for high concurrency                                      |

## ðŸ§  Major System Design Patterns it Implements

| System Design Pattern            | Role in Spring Cloud Gateway                                                |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway Pattern**          | Central entry point for all client requests                                 |
| **Reverse Proxy**                | Forwards requests to appropriate services                                   |
| **Facade Pattern**               | Hides complexity of backend service interactions                            |
| **Gateway Aggregation**          | Aggregates responses from multiple services (manually via filters/handlers) |
| **Service Discovery**            | Discovers service instances (via Eureka, Consul)                            |
| **Circuit Breaker / Resilience** | Handles failure gracefully with retries/fallbacks                           |
| **Security Gateway**             | Centralized authentication/authorization via filters                        |

## ðŸ“˜ Example: Routing with Filters and Rate Limiting

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: order-service
          uri: lb://ORDER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
          filters:
            - name: RequestRateLimiter
              args:
                redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
                redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
            - name: CircuitBreaker
              args:
                name: orderCB
                fallbackUri: forward:/fallback/order
```

## âœ… Benefits in Microservices Architecture

| Benefit                             | Description                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplifies client logic**         | Client talks to one endpoint instead of many |
| **Centralized control**             | Auth, logging, and routing in one place      |
| **Decouples clients from services** | Services can evolve independently            |
| **Enables cross-cutting concerns**  | Like auth, rate limiting, tracing            |
