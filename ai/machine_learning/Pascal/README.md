Blaise Pascal’s contributions are also alive and well in modern machine learning — but in a **different way than Euclid**.

Where Euclid gave us the *geometry* of ML, **Pascal gave us the probability side**.

## 1. **Foundation of Probability Theory**

In 1654, Pascal and Fermat solved the **Problem of Points** (how to fairly divide stakes in an interrupted game).
This is considered the *birth of probability theory*.

**ML Connection**:

* Almost all ML models that deal with uncertainty — from **Bayesian networks** to **probabilistic classifiers** — are built on probability theory that traces back to Pascal.

---

## 2. **Pascal’s Triangle**

Pascal formalized a triangular arrangement of binomial coefficients:

```
      1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
```

**Properties**:

* Each number is the sum of the two above it.
* Coefficients are $\binom{n}{k}$ from the binomial theorem.

**ML Uses**:

* **Binomial probabilities** (Bernoulli trials, classification accuracy modeling).
* **Feature combination counts** in combinatorial feature engineering.
* **Polynomial expansions** in kernel methods (e.g., polynomial kernel in SVMs).
* **Naïve Bayes** with binomial likelihood for binary features.

## 3. **Expected Value**

Pascal used expected value reasoning in games of chance.
The **expected value** formula is now central in ML:

$$
E[X] = \sum x_i P(x_i) \quad \text{(discrete)}, \quad
E[X] = \int x f(x) dx \quad \text{(continuous)}
$$

**ML Uses**:

* Loss functions are *expected errors* over data distribution.
* Policy evaluation in **reinforcement learning** uses expected rewards.
* Decision theory in classification (minimizing expected cost).

---

## 4. **Pascal’s Wager** (philosophical, but with decision theory flavor)

While about belief in God, the structure is a **decision under uncertainty** problem.
This thinking parallels:

* **Decision trees** in ML
* **Utility maximization** in AI
* **Risk-sensitive learning**

| Pascal’s Contribution             | Modern ML Usage                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Pascal’s Triangle**             | Binomial probabilities, combinatorics, polynomial kernels |
| **Expected value**                | Loss functions, reinforcement learning rewards            |
| **Decision under uncertainty**    | Decision trees, cost-sensitive learning                   |

If you want, I can also **connect Pascal’s and Euclid’s contributions in a single diagram** showing how *geometry* and *probability* meet in ML — for example in algorithms like **KNN (geometry)** vs **Naïve Bayes (probability)**. That way you can see how both shaped two major “families” of machine learning.
