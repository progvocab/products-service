Great question.

### üß© Short Answer:

**You can perform most high-level actions on Kafka via Kafdrop**, but **Zookeeper is still needed (for older Kafka versions)** behind the scenes for cluster metadata and configuration **unless you're using KRaft (Kafka without Zookeeper)**.

### üîç Let‚Äôs break it down:

#### ‚úÖ What You Can Do with **Kafdrop**:

Kafdrop is a **read-only web UI** for Kafka, which means it‚Äôs mostly used for **monitoring and inspection**, not full management.

**With Kafdrop, you can:**

* View topics and their partitions
* View consumers and consumer groups
* Browse and inspect messages in topics
* See offsets, lag, and brokers

‚ùå **Kafdrop cannot:**

* Create or delete topics (unless custom extensions added)
* Change broker configurations
* Add/remove Kafka brokers or manage ACLs
* Reassign partitions or trigger leader election

---

### üß† What is Zookeeper's role in Kafka?

Until Kafka 2.8.x, Kafka **depends on Zookeeper** to:

* Maintain cluster metadata (brokers, topics, configs)
* Perform leader election
* Manage controller nodes

You **cannot fully manage or run a Kafka cluster without Zookeeper**, unless you're using...

### üÜï Kafka with **KRaft mode** (Kafka Raft Metadata Mode)

Starting from **Kafka 2.8 (preview) and 3.3+ (production ready)**, Kafka can run in **KRaft mode**, meaning:

* **No Zookeeper required**
* Metadata stored internally in Kafka logs using Raft consensus

In this case:

* You manage Kafka directly via Kafka CLI tools or APIs (e.g. `kafka-topics.sh`, `kafka-configs.sh`)
* Zookeeper is **not used at all**
* Kafdrop **can still be used for inspection**, but not for full cluster management

### üîö Summary

| Tool          | Used For                                       | Can Perform All Kafka Actions? | Requires Zookeeper            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Kafdrop**   | View topics, partitions, consumers, messages   | ‚ùå No                           | ‚úÖ Yes (unless using KRaft)    |
| **Zookeeper** | Metadata storage & leader election (old Kafka) | ‚úÖ Indirectly required          | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| **Kafka CLI** | Full management (`kafka-*` scripts)            | ‚úÖ Yes                          | Depends on mode (ZK or KRaft) |

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation:

* Use **Kafdrop for monitoring/debugging**
* Use **Kafka CLI tools for creating, updating, deleting topics, configs, etc.**
* Consider moving to **KRaft mode** if starting a new Kafka cluster to simplify architecture (no Zookeeper).

Let me know if you want a setup comparison or migration guide from Zookeeper to KRaft.
