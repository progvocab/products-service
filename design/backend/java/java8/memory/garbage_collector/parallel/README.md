Got it üëç Let‚Äôs go in detail about the **Parallel Garbage Collector** in Java.

---

## üåê What is the Parallel Garbage Collector?

* The **Parallel GC** (a.k.a. "Throughput Collector") is the **default garbage collector** in Java 8.
* It focuses on **maximizing application throughput** (total work done by the application vs. GC overhead).
* It does this by using **multiple threads in parallel** to speed up garbage collection tasks (mainly **minor GC** in the Young Generation and also major GC in the Old Generation).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Parallel GC Works

### 1. **Generational Heap Layout**

The heap is divided into:

* **Young Generation** (Eden + Survivor spaces)
* **Old Generation (Tenured)**
* **Metaspace** (for class metadata, not part of heap since Java 8)

### 2. **Young Generation Collection (Minor GC)**

* When Eden fills up:

  * Multiple GC threads **pause all application threads (STW)**.
  * GC threads **copy live objects** from Eden to Survivor spaces or Old Gen.
  * Dead objects are discarded.
* This copying process is **parallelized**, so it‚Äôs faster on multi-core CPUs.

### 3. **Old Generation Collection (Major/Full GC)**

* Uses **parallel mark-compact**:

  1. **Mark phase:** Finds live objects.
  2. **Compact phase:** Moves objects together to remove fragmentation and update references.
* Still **Stop-The-World (STW)**, but performed by multiple threads in parallel.

---

## üìä Characteristics of Parallel GC

* **STW pauses**: Both minor and major GC stop all application threads.
* **Parallelism**: Uses multiple GC threads to reduce pause duration.
* **Focus on throughput**: Good for batch jobs, big data apps, or applications where long pauses are acceptable but throughput matters.
* **Less suited for low-latency applications** (where GC pauses must be minimized).

## üîß JVM Options for Parallel GC

```bash
# Enable Parallel GC explicitly (Java 9+ defaults to G1GC, so you may need this)
-XX:+UseParallelGC

# Set number of threads used by Parallel GC
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<n>

# Enable parallel compaction of the Old Generation
-XX:+UseParallelOldGC

# Control heap sizes
-Xms512m      # initial heap size
-Xmx2g        # max heap size
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Parallel GC in Action

```java
public class ParallelGCExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            // Create short-lived objects to fill Eden space
            byte[] data = new byte[1024 * 100]; // 100 KB
        }
        System.out.println("Finished allocation loop!");
    }
}
```

Run with Parallel GC:

```bash
java -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xms512m -Xmx512m ParallelGCExample
```

You‚Äôll see **GC logs** showing **parallel minor collections** like:

```
[GC (Allocation Failure) [PSYoungGen: 131072K->17472K(153600K)] ...
[Full GC (Ergonomics) [PSYoungGen: ...] [ParOldGen: ...]
```

Here:

* `PSYoungGen` = Parallel Scavenge (Young Gen collector)
* `ParOldGen` = Parallel Old Gen collector

## üìå Summary

| Aspect         | Parallel GC                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Goal**       | Max throughput                                                     |
| **STW Pauses** | Yes, for both Young & Old collections                              |
| **Threads**    | Multiple GC threads                                                |
| **Best For**   | Batch jobs, background processing, apps where throughput > latency |
| **Weakness**   | Not ideal for low-latency apps (pauses noticeable)                 |

üëâ Next, I can compare **Parallel GC vs G1 GC** with pros/cons and use cases, since they are often confused.
Do you want me to prepare a **side-by-side comparison of Parallel GC vs G1 GC**?


Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs visualize the **Java memory layout** when the **Parallel Garbage Collector (Parallel GC / Throughput Collector)** is in use.

## üß† JVM Memory Layout (with Parallel GC)

The JVM memory can broadly be divided into:

1. **Heap Memory (managed by GC)**

   * **Young Generation**

     * **Eden Space** ‚Äì new objects are allocated here.
     * **Survivor Space S0 / S1** ‚Äì surviving objects copied back and forth.
   * **Old Generation (Tenured)** ‚Äì long-lived objects promoted here.
2. **Non-Heap Memory (not directly managed by Parallel GC)**

   * **Metaspace** ‚Äì class metadata, method definitions (since Java 8).
   * **Code Cache** ‚Äì JIT compiled code.
   * **Thread Stacks** ‚Äì each thread gets its own stack.
   * **Native Memory** ‚Äì libraries, buffers, OS allocations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Parallel GC Works on This Layout

* **Minor GC (Young Gen):**

  * Multiple GC threads stop the application (`STW`).
  * Copy live objects from **Eden ‚Üí Survivor space (S0/S1)**.
  * Swap survivor spaces after each collection.
  * Objects that survive multiple cycles get **promoted to Old Gen**.

* **Major GC (Old Gen):**

  * Parallel mark-compact algorithm.
  * All GC threads run in parallel.
  * Live objects marked ‚Üí compacted ‚Üí references updated.
  * Removes **fragmentation** in Old Gen.

---

‚úÖ This layout is **static** (Eden, Survivor, Old Gen always exist), unlike **G1GC**, which splits the heap into **uniform regions**.

Would you like me to **draw a side-by-side diagram comparing Parallel GC vs G1 GC heap layout** so you can visually see how their heap structures differ?
