### **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in PySpark**

In **PySpark**, the **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is the **logical execution plan** for a Spark job. It represents the sequence of computations that need to be performed on data, and it ensures fault tolerance and efficient execution.

---

### **What is a DAG?**
- A **DAG** is a graph where:
  - **Nodes** represent RDD/DataFrame transformations or actions.
  - **Edges** represent the flow of data between operations.
- It is **directed**, meaning the flow of data goes in one direction.
- It is **acyclic**, meaning there are no loops or cycles in the graph.

In PySpark:
1. **Transformations** (like `map`, `filter`, `join`) are **lazy** and build the DAG.
2. **Actions** (like `collect`, `count`, `show`) trigger the execution of the DAG.

---

### **How DAG Works in PySpark**
1. **Stage Creation**:
   - PySpark divides the DAG into multiple **stages** based on **wide** and **narrow dependencies**.
     - **Narrow Dependency**: Each partition of the parent RDD contributes to only one partition of the child RDD (e.g., `map`, `filter`).
     - **Wide Dependency**: A partition of the parent RDD contributes to multiple partitions of the child RDD (e.g., `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`).

2. **Task Scheduling**:
   - Each stage is further divided into **tasks** based on the number of partitions.

3. **Execution**:
   - Stages are executed sequentially, while tasks within a stage are executed in parallel.

### **DAG in Action (PySpark Example)**

Here’s how a simple PySpark program builds and executes a DAG:

#### **Code Example**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DAGExample").getOrCreate()

# Example Data
data = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25), ("Cathy", 27), ("David", 35)]

# Create RDD
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data)

# Transformation 1: Filter
filtered_rdd = rdd.filter(lambda x: x[1] > 28)  # People older than 28

# Transformation 2: Map
mapped_rdd = filtered_rdd.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1] * 2))  # Double the age

# Action: Collect
result = mapped_rdd.collect()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

#### **Step-by-Step DAG Creation and Execution**
1. **DAG Construction** (Logical Plan):
   - PySpark creates a logical DAG:
     - `parallelize`: Creates the base RDD (source).
     - `filter`: Adds a node for filtering.
     - `map`: Adds a node for mapping.
     - `collect`: Triggers the DAG execution.

2. **Stage Division**:
   - `filter` and `map` are narrow transformations, so they are combined into a single stage.

3. **Execution**:
   - PySpark executes the tasks in parallel across the partitions.

### **Visualizing the DAG**
You can use the **Spark UI** to visualize the DAG:
1. Run your PySpark application.
2. Open the Spark UI (typically accessible at `http://localhost:4040`).
3. Navigate to the **DAG Visualization** tab to see the stages and tasks.

---

### **Transformations and DAG**
Here’s how common transformations affect the DAG:
- **Narrow Transformations** (single stage):
  - `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`
- **Wide Transformations** (new stage):
  - `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, `join`

---

### **Advantages of DAG in PySpark**
1. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - If a task fails, Spark can recompute only the required portion of the DAG.
   
2. **Optimization**:
   - PySpark optimizes the DAG by combining transformations into a **logical plan** and then creating an **optimized physical plan**.
   
3. **Scalability**:
   - Tasks in a stage run in parallel, making Spark highly scalable.

4. **Lazy Execution**:
   - Transformations are only computed when an action is triggered, allowing efficient resource utilization.

---

### **Key Points**
- A DAG represents the lineage of transformations on the data.
- It divides the computations into **stages** and **tasks**.
- PySpark optimizes the DAG before execution for better performance.
