## **G1 Garbage Collector (G1 GC)**
- has been the **default collector since Java 9**.
- Concorrent Garbage collector , does not pauses the application thread - only a short pause is required

---

# 🔹 1. Why G1 GC?

Before G1, Java mostly used:

* **Parallel GC (Throughput collector)** → Fast, but had **long Stop-the-World (STW) pauses**.
* **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)** → Lower pauses, but suffered from **fragmentation** and unpredictable compaction.

👉 G1 GC was designed to **combine the best of both**:

* **Predictable pause times** (low-latency, configurable).
* **Parallel + concurrent work**.
* **Region-based design** to avoid fragmentation.

---

# 🔹 2. Heap Layout (Partitioning into Regions)

Unlike traditional collectors (Young vs Old continuous spaces), G1 divides the heap into many **equal-sized regions** (1MB–32MB each, depending on heap size).

```
Heap
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | ...
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Regions can be:
- Eden (new objects)
- Survivor (surviving young objects)
- Old (long-lived objects)
- Humongous (large objects spanning regions)
```

This **partitioning avoids fragmentation** since objects can be relocated between regions.

---

# 🔹 3. G1 GC Phases

### **(A) Young GC (Minor GC)**

* Happens when Eden fills.
* **Stop-the-world (but parallel):**

  * Live objects copied from Eden → Survivor or Old regions.
  * Dead objects discarded.
* Multiple threads evacuate regions in parallel.

---

### **(B) Concurrent Marking**

* Runs **concurrently** with application threads.
* Identifies live objects in Old regions.
* Uses SATB (Snapshot-At-The-Beginning) algorithm → sees all objects reachable at start of marking.

---

### **(C) Remark (short STW)**

* Fixes up references changed during concurrent marking.
* Short pause compared to CMS.

---

### **(D) Mixed GC**

* After marking, G1 knows which Old regions have most garbage.
* Performs **Mixed Collections**:

  * Collects Eden + some Old regions in the same cycle.
  * Prioritizes regions with **most garbage** → hence the name **Garbage First (G1)**.

---

### **(E) Compaction**

* G1 **always evacuates live objects into new regions**, so compaction is **built-in**.
* No fragmentation problem like CMS.

---

# 🔹 4. Pause Time Goal

You can **tune pause times** with:

```bash
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
```

* G1 tries to meet this pause goal by selecting the right number of regions to collect.
* Predictable latency, even for **large heaps (tens of GBs)**.

---

# 🔹 5. Humongous Objects

* Objects larger than **50% of a region size** are stored in **Humongous regions** (spanning multiple contiguous regions).
* G1 tries to clean them, but very large objects can still cause allocation pressure.

---

# 🔹 6. G1 vs Others

| Feature            | Parallel GC            | CMS                     | **G1 GC**                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Heap layout        | Young + Old contiguous | Young + Old contiguous  | Region-based               |
| Compaction         | STW compaction         | No (fragmentation risk) | Always (region evacuation) |
| Concurrency        | No                     | Yes (mark+sweep)        | Yes (mark + mixed GC)      |
| Pause time control | No                     | Limited                 | Yes (`MaxGCPauseMillis`)   |
| Best for           | Throughput             | Lower pauses            | Predictable latency        |

---

# 🔹 7. Example JVM Options

```bash
java -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -Xmx4g MyApp
```

* Enables G1 GC.
* Sets target max pause time to 200ms.
* Heap size = 4GB.

---

# 🔹 8. Analogy

Think of G1 as a **city garbage service**:

* City = Heap.
* Divided into **districts (regions)**.
* Garbage trucks (GC threads) **first clean the dirtiest districts** (regions with most garbage).
* This keeps the city livable without shutting it down completely.

---

✅ **Summary**

* G1 GC = **Region-based, concurrent, compacting, low-pause collector**.
* Always avoids fragmentation.
* Balances **throughput + latency**.
* Default since Java 9.

---

Would you like me to also draw a **timeline diagram of G1 GC phases** (showing where mutator threads run vs where STW pauses happen)?


Great 👍 Let’s visualize the **timeline of G1 GC phases** showing how **application threads (mutators)** and **GC threads** interleave.

```

---

# 🔹 Explanation of Timeline

1. **Young GC (Minor GC)**

   * Stop-the-world (STW), parallel.
   * Live objects copied from Eden → Survivor/Old.
   * Pause is **short** since regions are small.

2. **Concurrent Marking**

   * Runs **alongside the application**.
   * GC threads walk the heap to mark live objects in Old Gen.
   * Mutator threads keep running.

3. **Remark**

   * Short STW pause to catch up on changes made during marking.
   * Much shorter than CMS’s remark phase.

4. **Mixed GC**

   * Collects both Young regions + some Old regions with most garbage.
   * Still STW, but parallel and short.
   * Compaction happens automatically during evacuation → no fragmentation.

---

# 🔹 Key Points in Diagram

* Application threads mostly run **uninterrupted**.
* STW pauses happen but are **short and predictable**.
* Concurrent work (marking) reduces long pauses.
* G1 selects “garbage-first” regions → keeps pauses within `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`.

---

✅ So the timeline shows **mutators and GC interleaving**:

* **STW phases are short and infrequent.**
* **Concurrent phases happen in the background.**

---

Would you like me to also draw a **heap diagram with regions (Eden, Survivor, Old, Humongous)** to show how G1 moves objects around during these phases?


Perfect 👍 Let’s illustrate the **G1 GC heap layout with regions** and how objects move during GC.

---

# 🔹 1. Heap Partitioning in G1 GC

Instead of fixed contiguous Young/Old generations, the heap is split into **equal-sized regions** (1MB–32MB).

```
Heap (divided into regions)
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | R8 | R9 |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Each region can be:
- Eden (new allocations)
- Survivor (young survivors)
- Old (long-lived objects)
- Humongous (very large objects)
```

---

# 🔹 2. Young GC (Evacuation)

When **Eden fills up**, a **Young GC** happens:

```
Before GC:
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|Eden|Eden|Eden|Surv|Old |Old |Old |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

After GC (evacuation):
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|Eden|Eden|Surv|Surv|Old |Old |Old |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

- Live objects from Eden → moved to Survivor or Old.
- Dead objects in Eden → discarded.
- Eden regions cleared for reuse.
```

👉 This **compacts memory** automatically — no fragmentation.

---

# 🔹 3. Concurrent Marking + Mixed GC

During concurrent marking, G1 identifies Old regions with lots of garbage.
Then it performs a **Mixed GC**: collects Eden + some Old regions with high garbage.

```
Before Mixed GC:
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|Eden|Eden|Surv|Old |Old*|Old*|Old |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                (Old* = mostly garbage)

After Mixed GC:
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|Eden|Eden|Surv|Old |Free|Free|Old |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

- Old* regions evacuated → objects moved elsewhere.
- Regions reclaimed → now empty (Free).
```

👉 G1 focuses on “garbage-first” regions (the ones with most garbage) to meet pause-time goals.

---

# 🔹 4. Humongous Objects

If an object > **50% of a region size**, it’s stored in **Humongous regions**.

```
+----+----+----+----+----+
|Humongous Object (spans)|
+----+----+----+----+----+
```

* These are more costly to manage.
* G1 tries to collect them during mixed cycles.

---

# ✅ Summary

* **Heap = partitioned into regions.**
* **Young GC = evacuates Eden → Survivor/Old (compaction built-in).**
* **Concurrent marking = finds garbage-heavy Old regions.**
* **Mixed GC = reclaims Young + Old regions with most garbage.**
* **Humongous objects = allocated in multiple contiguous regions.**

---

👉 Do you want me to now **compare G1 GC’s region-based compaction with CMS’s fragmentation issue** using a side-by-side diagram?

Ah, this is an important question! The reason **Shenandoah GC or ZGC aren’t the default GC** in Java, despite their impressive low-pause behavior, comes down to **trade-offs, stability, ecosystem compatibility, and workload patterns**. Let me break it down carefully:

---

## **1️⃣ G1 Is the Default for a Reason**

* **G1** has been the default since **Java 9**.
* It is a **well-balanced GC** that works for the **majority of applications**: medium-to-large heaps, moderate latency needs.
* It offers **predictable behavior**, reasonable throughput, and moderate pause times.
* **Mature and battle-tested** across a wide variety of applications, frameworks, and JVM workloads.

---

## **2️⃣ ZGC and Shenandoah Are Specialized**

| Feature      | ZGC                           | Shenandoah                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Primary Goal | Ultra-low latency (<10 ms)    | Low pause times (few ms)       |
| Heap Size    | Multi-terabyte                | Large heaps, but less than ZGC |
| Tuning Needs | Minimal                       | Minimal                        |
| Maturity     | Introduced in Java 11         | Introduced in Java 12          |
| Use Case     | Latency-sensitive, huge heaps | Latency-sensitive, large heaps |

**Key point:** They are **not optimized for the “average” Java workload**, which may not need such aggressive low-pause behavior.

---

## **3️⃣ Performance Trade-offs**

* **Throughput vs Pause Time**

  * G1 is optimized for **throughput and balanced performance**.
  * ZGC and Shenandoah may incur slightly **higher CPU overhead** for concurrent tracking, coloring, and compaction.
  * For apps where millisecond pauses aren’t critical, G1 can actually be more efficient overall.

* **Memory Overhead**

  * ZGC and Shenandoah use **extra metadata and colored pointers** to track object references.
  * This adds **slight memory overhead** compared to G1, which may be unnecessary for standard workloads.

---

## **4️⃣ Ecosystem & Stability**

* G1 has been **production-default for years**, and the Java ecosystem (frameworks, monitoring tools, profilers) is tuned to work with it.
* ZGC and Shenandoah are newer and **not as battle-tested across all workloads**.
* Some libraries or JVM options may behave slightly differently under ZGC/Shenandoah (e.g., very large heaps, exotic memory patterns).

---

## **5️⃣ Adoption Strategy**

* Oracle and OpenJDK prefer a **conservative default**: G1.
* They **encourage developers to test ZGC or Shenandoah** for specialized workloads.
* This avoids **unexpected behavior or regressions** in the majority of enterprise applications.

---

### **6️⃣ TL;DR**

* **G1** → default because it’s **stable, predictable, good for most apps, balanced pause/throughput**.
* **ZGC / Shenandoah** → excellent for **latency-critical, large-heap apps**, but slightly higher overhead and newer, so not the default.
* Essentially: **“default = works well for most; specialized GCs = use when you need extreme low-latency or huge heaps.”**

---

If you want, I can make a **diagram comparing G1 vs ZGC vs Shenandoah default suitability**, showing **heap size, pause time, CPU overhead, and recommended workloads**, which makes the trade-offs crystal clear.

Do you want me to do that?
