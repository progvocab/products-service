Excellent question 👍. Git’s source code (written in C) internally uses a **combination of trees and graphs** to represent commits, history, and data objects. Let’s break it down systematically.

---

# 🔹 1. Git Data Model (Conceptual)

At its core, Git is built around four object types stored in its object database (`.git/objects/`):

* **Blob** → file contents
* **Tree** → directory structure (a tree of blobs & other trees)
* **Commit** → snapshot reference to a tree + parent commits
* **Tag** → human-friendly label pointing to a commit

These objects are linked via **SHA-1 (or SHA-256 in newer versions) hashes**, forming a **graph**.

---

# 🔹 2. Tree Data Structures in Git

* A **Git tree object** represents a directory.
* Each entry in the tree has:

  * file mode (permissions)
  * filename
  * SHA hash (points to either a blob or another tree)

For example, a `.git/objects` tree might look like:

```
tree (root)
├── src/   → tree
│   ├── main.c → blob
│   └── util.c → blob
└── README.md  → blob
```

Internally, Git’s `tree.c` and `tree.h` files define functions to parse and traverse tree objects.

---

# 🔹 3. Graph Data Structures in Git

Git’s commit history is modeled as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**:

* Each **commit** points to:

  * a **tree** (snapshot of the repo at that point)
  * one or more **parent commits**
* Multiple parents → **merge commits**
* No cycles → history always moves forward

Example graph:

```
A → B → C
      ↘ D
        ↘ E (merge)
```

Git source code:

* `commit.c`, `commit.h` handle commit parsing
* Commits are stored in memory as nodes in a graph with adjacency (parents → children)

---

# 🔹 4. Key Structures in Source Code

Looking at `commit.h` (simplified):

```c
struct commit {
    struct object object;   // base object (hash, type, etc.)
    struct tree *tree;      // pointer to associated tree
    struct commit_list *parents; // linked list of parent commits
    unsigned int flags;     // metadata (reachable, seen, etc.)
};
```

And `tree.h`:

```c
struct tree {
    struct object object;   // base object
    struct tree_entry *entries; // list of files/subtrees
};
```

So:

* **Tree** = recursive directory structure
* **Commit** = node in a DAG with pointers to tree + parents

---

# 🔹 5. Why Both Tree & Graph?

* **Tree** → captures one snapshot of the filesystem
* **Graph (of commits)** → captures evolution over time
* Combined, Git provides **versioned snapshots**.

---

# 🔹 6. Example in Practice

When you run:

```bash
git log --graph --oneline
```

Git is literally traversing this **commit DAG** and printing the history.
When you run:

```bash
git ls-tree HEAD
```

Git is traversing the **tree object** inside the latest commit.

---

# 🔹 7. Performance Optimizations

* Git stores commit DAGs in **commit-graph files** for faster traversal (`.git/objects/info/commit-graph`).
* Uses **packfiles** (binary delta-compressed blobs/trees/commits) to store data efficiently.
* Traversals often use BFS/DFS on the commit DAG (see `revision.c`).

---

✅ So in summary:

* Git **trees** = file system snapshots (hierarchical data structure).
* Git **graphs** = commit history (DAG of snapshots over time).
* Internally represented with structs (`tree`, `commit`) and traversed with linked lists and graph traversal algorithms.

---


Let’s visualize how **Git’s commit graph** (DAG) connects to **tree structures** (directory snapshots).

---

# 🔹 Git Commit Graph + Tree Diagram

```
 Commit DAG (History)
 ┌───────────┐
 │ Commit A  │───┐
 │ Tree: T1  │   │
 └───────────┘   │
                  │
 ┌───────────┐    │
 │ Commit B  │◀───┘   (B has parent A)
 │ Tree: T2  │
 └───────────┘
      │
      ▼
 ┌───────────┐
 │ Commit C  │
 │ Tree: T3  │
 └───────────┘
```

Each **commit** points to:

* A **tree object** (snapshot of the repo)
* One or more **parent commits** (forming a DAG)

---

# 🔹 Tree Objects (Directory Snapshots)

Let’s expand **Tree T2**:

```
Tree T2 (root directory)
├── src/  → Tree T2.1
│   ├── main.c   → Blob (file contents)
│   └── util.c   → Blob
└── README.md    → Blob
```

Where:

* **Tree** = directory
* **Blob** = file contents

---

# 🔹 Full Connection Example

```
Commit C (hash: c3)
│
├── points to Tree T3 (root)
│   ├── src/ → Tree T3.1
│   │   ├── main.c → Blob (hash: ab1)
│   │   └── util.c → Blob (hash: cd2)
│   └── README.md → Blob (hash: ef3)
│
└── parent: Commit B (hash: b2)
```

So Git history is **graph of commits** → each commit points to a **tree** → tree recursively points to blobs.

---

# 🔹 Intuition

* **Graph (Commits)** = time dimension (history, merges, branches)
* **Tree (Directories)** = space dimension (files at that moment)

That’s why Git is so powerful: it combines a **time graph** with a **space tree**.

---

👉 Do you want me to go one level deeper and **show you the actual C structs in Git’s source code that link commits → trees → blobs**, with an annotated diagram of memory layout? That would tie the theory directly to Git internals.
