### Medium Level Kubernetes Question 1

Your application has intermittent latency spikes in a Kubernetes cluster. How would you investigate whether the issue is related to pod resource limits, node pressure, network policies, or kube-proxy configuration?

### Medium Level Kubernetes Question 2

A Deployment is stuck with pods in CrashLoopBackOff. What steps would you take using logs, events, readiness probes, and ConfigMap or Secret debugging to isolate the cause?

### Medium Level Kubernetes Question 3

Explain how you would design a zero-downtime rolling update strategy for a production microservice. Include how you would configure readiness probes, maxSurge, maxUnavailable, and PodDisruptionBudgets.

### Medium Level Kubernetes Question 4

A service exposed via an Ingress is reachable internally but not externally. What checks would you perform involving Ingress controller logs, service type, DNS propagation, and security groups or firewalls?

### Medium Level Kubernetes Question 5

Your StatefulSet pods are failing to mount a PersistentVolumeClaim. How would you debug issues related to storage classes, dynamic provisioning, reclaim policies, and node-availability constraints?

If you want, I can also answer these or generate harder scenario-based questions.
