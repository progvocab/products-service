When you type a URL (say `www.google.com`) in the browser, and the **OS cache doesnâ€™t have the DNS â†’ IP mapping**, the system goes through the full DNS resolution flow.

### ðŸ”¹ Steps Involved (DNS Lookup without OS Cache)

1. **Browser Check** â€“ Browser checks its own DNS cache.
2. **OS Cache Check** â€“ OS checks local DNS resolver cache (empty in this case).
3. **DNS Resolver (usually ISP/Configured DNS)** â€“ Request is forwarded to the recursive DNS resolver.
4. **Root DNS Server** â€“ Resolver queries root server to find the responsible TLD server (e.g., `.com`).
5. **TLD DNS Server** â€“ TLD server responds with the authoritative DNS server for the domain (`google.com`).
6. **Authoritative DNS Server** â€“ Resolver queries it to get the actual IP address of `www.google.com`.
7. **Resolver Caching** â€“ Resolver caches the response for future use.
8. **OS Caching** â€“ OS caches the IP for TTL (time-to-live).
9. **Browser Proceeds** â€“ Browser uses the IP to initiate TCP/TLS connection with the server.

Would you like me to also extend this diagram to **show caching hierarchy visually** (Browser â†’ OS â†’ Resolver â†’ Root â†’ TLD â†’ Authoritative) as a **flowchart-style diagram**, or keep it strictly sequence-based?
