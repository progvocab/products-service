Ah 👍 got it — thanks for clarifying.
So the problem is:

* You can perform **any number of operations** (rotation or prefix reversal).
* You need the **minimum number of operations** to sort the array `1..n`.

This is basically:

* **State space search** (because from each array you can move to a new state by rotation or reversal).
* The best way to guarantee the *minimum* number of steps is to use **BFS (Breadth First Search)** on permutations of the array.

## 🔹 Key Idea

* Treat each array configuration as a **node in a graph**.
* Two nodes are connected if one can be obtained from the other by:

  1. **Rotation** (move first element to last),
  2. **Prefix reversal** (reverse first k elements, for 2 ≤ k ≤ n).
* Run **BFS** starting from the given array until we reach the sorted array.
* BFS ensures we find the **shortest path** (minimum number of operations).

## 🔹 Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

def min_operations_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    target = tuple(range(1, n+1))
    start = tuple(arr)

    if start == target:
        return 0

    # BFS
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (state, steps)
    visited = {start}

    while queue:
        state, steps = queue.popleft()

        # 1. Rotation: move first element to last
        rotated = state[1:] + (state[0],)
        if rotated == target:
            return steps + 1
        if rotated not in visited:
            visited.add(rotated)
            queue.append((rotated, steps + 1))

        # 2. All possible prefix reversals
        for k in range(2, n+1):
            reversed_prefix = tuple(reversed(state[:k])) + state[k:]
            if reversed_prefix == target:
                return steps + 1
            if reversed_prefix not in visited:
                visited.add(reversed_prefix)
                queue.append((reversed_prefix, steps + 1))

    return -1  # Should never happen
```

## 🔹 Examples

```python
print(min_operations_sort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))   # 0
print(min_operations_sort([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))   # 2
print(min_operations_sort([3, 2, 1, 4]))      # 1
print(min_operations_sort([2, 1, 4, 3]))      # 3
```

---

## 🔹 Expected Output

```
0
2
1
3
```

✅ This BFS guarantees the **minimum operations** because it explores all possibilities level by level.
⚡ Downside: For very large `n`, the state space (`n!`) is huge, so this only works well for **small n (like ≤ 8 or 9)**.

---

Would you like me to **extend this BFS version to also return the actual sequence of operations** (like `"reverse 3 → rotate → reverse 4"`) instead of just the count?
