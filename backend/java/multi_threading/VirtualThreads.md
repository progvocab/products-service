# Virtual Thread 
---

Virtual Threads in Java are a lightweight implementation of threads introduced as part of **Project Loom** (became a standard feature in **Java 21**). They are designed to make concurrency simpler and more scalable by reducing the overhead of traditional (platform) threads.

###  Traditional Threads (Platform Threads)

* Mapped **1:1 to OS threads**.
* Expensive to create and maintain (high memory footprint, typically 1–2 MB per thread stack).
* The number of concurrent threads is limited by OS resources.
* When a thread blocks (e.g., waiting on I/O), the OS thread is also blocked.

---

###  Virtual Threads

* Mapped **many-to-one** onto platform threads.
* Extremely lightweight (memory footprint is much smaller, often a few KB).
* Thousands or even millions of virtual threads can run concurrently.
* When a virtual thread blocks (e.g., on I/O), the **JVM unmounts** it from its carrier (platform) thread, freeing the OS thread to do other work.
* Resumes execution later on an available carrier thread.

This makes them especially useful for I/O-bound applications like web servers, databases, and message brokers.

###  Key Benefits

1. **Massive Concurrency** → Run millions of threads without running out of OS resources.
2. **Simplicity** → Write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about async frameworks (like `CompletableFuture` or reactive programming).
3. **Better Resource Utilization** → Platform threads are freed when virtual threads block.
4. **Interoperability** → Virtual threads work with existing Java concurrency APIs (`ExecutorService`, `Thread`, etc.).

###  Example

```java
public class VirtualThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println("Running in " + Thread.currentThread());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // blocking call
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        };

        // Create a virtual thread
        Thread vt = Thread.ofVirtual().start(task);

        vt.join();
    }
}
```

### Executor with Virtual Threads

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class VirtualThreadExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1_000; i++) {
                int id = i;
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    System.out.println("Task " + id + " in " + Thread.currentThread());
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // blocking, but efficient
                    return id;
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **In short**:
Virtual Threads in Java are lightweight, scalable threads that let you write simple blocking code while handling massive concurrency (millions of threads) efficiently. They don’t replace platform threads but sit on top of them.

Would you like me to also explain **how the JVM internally manages scheduling and parking/unparking of virtual threads** (the mechanics behind them), or keep it at usage level?
