# üîπ What is a **Regressor** in Machine Learning?

A **regressor** is a machine learning model that predicts a **continuous numerical value** (not a discrete category like a classifier).

üëâ Example:

* **House price prediction** (‚Çπ80L, ‚Çπ1.2Cr, etc.)
* **Temperature forecasting** (29.3¬∞C, 32.7¬∞C)
* **Stock price prediction**

So:

* **Classifier ‚Üí Discrete output (categories)**
* **Regressor ‚Üí Continuous output (real numbers)**

# üîπ Types of Regression Models (Regressors)

| Type                                                     | Description                                                                                | Example Use Case                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Linear Regression**                                 | Fits a straight line (y = m¬∑x + c) to model relationship between input (X) and output (y). | Predict house price based on area.                   |
| **2. Multiple Linear Regression**                        | Extension of linear regression with multiple input features.                               | Predict salary based on experience, education, age.  |
| **3. Polynomial Regression**                             | Uses polynomial features (curved line fit).                                                | Predict growth curves (population growth).           |
| **4. Ridge & Lasso Regression (Regularized Regression)** | Adds penalty terms to prevent overfitting.                                                 | Predict stock prices with many correlated features.  |
| **5. Logistic Regression** *(misleading name)*           | Actually a **classifier**, but used for probabilities.                                     | Spam/Not Spam classification.                        |
| **6. Decision Tree Regression**                          | Splits data into regions and predicts values using decision trees.                         | Predict crop yield based on soil type.               |
| **7. Random Forest Regression**                          | Ensemble of decision trees, averages predictions.                                          | Predict car prices more accurately.                  |
| **8. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**                   | Extension of SVM for regression tasks.                                                     | Predict real estate prices.                          |
| **9. k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (k-NN Regressor)**   | Uses average of nearest neighbors‚Äô values.                                                 | Predict a student‚Äôs score based on similar students. |
| **10. Neural Network Regression**                        | Deep learning model to approximate any complex function.                                   | Predict electricity demand from past usage patterns. |

# üîπ Example: Predicting House Price

Inputs:

* Area (sq ft) = 1200
* Bedrooms = 3
* Age of house = 10 years

Training data:

| Area | Bedrooms | Age | Price (‚Çπ in Lakh) |
| ---- | -------- | --- | ----------------- |
| 1000 | 2        | 5   | 50                |
| 1500 | 3        | 8   | 75                |
| 1200 | 3        | 10  | 60                |

üëâ The **regressor** learns a function:

$$
Price = f(Area, Bedrooms, Age)
$$

New input: \[1300, 3, 7] ‚Üí Predicted Price = ‚Çπ68L

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* **Classifier** ‚Üí predicts categories (Yes/No, Cat/Dog).
* **Regressor** ‚Üí predicts continuous values (Price, Temp, Stock).
* Many ML algorithms can act as both (Decision Trees, Neural Nets), depending on whether the target is categorical or continuous.

Do you want me to also make a **side-by-side comparison of classifier vs regressor with math equations** for clarity?
