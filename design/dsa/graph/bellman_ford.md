Here's a complete and clean implementation of the **Bellman-Ford algorithm** in Python to find the **shortest path from a single source node** in a **weighted graph**, including support for **negative weights** and detection of **negative weight cycles**.

---

## ‚úÖ Bellman-Ford Algorithm Overview

* Works on both **directed** and **undirected** graphs (undirected must be handled carefully if negative weights exist).
* Time Complexity: **O(V √ó E)**
* Can detect **negative weight cycles** (unlike Dijkstra).

---

## üîß Python Implementation

```python
def bellman_ford(vertices, edges, source):
    # Step 1: Initialize distances from source
    distance = {v: float('inf') for v in range(vertices)}
    distance[source] = 0

    # Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times
    for _ in range(vertices - 1):
        for u, v, wt in edges:
            if distance[u] + wt < distance[v]:
                distance[v] = distance[u] + wt

    # Step 3: Check for negative-weight cycles
    for u, v, wt in edges:
        if distance[u] + wt < distance[v]:
            print("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
            return None

    return distance
```

## üß™ Example Usage

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    vertices = 5  # Nodes: 0 to 4
    edges = [
        (0, 1, -1),
        (0, 2, 4),
        (1, 2, 3),
        (1, 3, 2),
        (1, 4, 2),
        (3, 2, 5),
        (3, 1, 1),
        (4, 3, -3)
    ]

    source = 0
    dist = bellman_ford(vertices, edges, source)

    if dist:
        print(f"Shortest distances from node {source}:")
        for node in range(vertices):
            print(f"Node {node}: {dist[node]}")
```

---

## üßæ Output

```
Shortest distances from node 0:
Node 0: 0
Node 1: -1
Node 2: 2
Node 3: -2
Node 4: 1
```

## üî• Notes

* If you want to **print the shortest path**, not just distance, keep a `predecessor[]` array.
* Works well even with negative weights, as long as there's **no negative cycle**.
* For undirected graphs, you must **add both directions of each edge**.

# üîπ Bellman‚ÄìFord Algorithm

The **Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm** is a **shortest path algorithm** that finds the minimum distance from a **single source vertex** to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

Unlike **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm**, it works even if the graph contains **negative edge weights** (but not negative cycles).

---

## üîπ Key Idea

* Relax all edges **V ‚àí 1 times**, where $V$ is the number of vertices.
* Relaxing means:
  If the distance to vertex $v$ through edge $u \to v$ is shorter than the current distance, update it.

Formally, if there‚Äôs an edge $u \to v$ with weight $w$:

$$
\text{if } dist[u] + w < dist[v] \text{ then } dist[v] = dist[u] + w
$$

---

## üîπ Steps

1. Initialize distance to all vertices = **‚àû**, except the source = **0**.
2. Repeat **V ‚àí 1 times**:

   * For each edge $(u, v, w)$, relax it.
3. Run one more pass:

   * If any edge can still be relaxed ‚Üí **negative cycle exists**.

---

## üîπ Pseudocode

```python
def bellman_ford(V, edges, source):
    # Step 1: Initialize distances
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[source] = 0
    
    # Step 2: Relax all edges V-1 times
    for _ in range(V - 1):
        for u, v, w in edges:
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w

    # Step 3: Check for negative cycles
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            print("Negative cycle detected!")
            return None

    return dist
```

---

## üîπ Example

Graph edges:
$(0 ‚Üí 1, 4), (0 ‚Üí 2, 5), (1 ‚Üí 2, -3), (2 ‚Üí 3, 2), (3 ‚Üí 1, 1)$

1. Start: `dist = [0, ‚àû, ‚àû, ‚àû]`
2. Relax edges (V‚àí1 = 3 times):

   * After 1st pass: `dist = [0, 4, 5, ‚àû]`
   * Relax 1‚Üí2 (-3): `dist = [0, 4, 1, ‚àû]`
   * Relax 2‚Üí3 (2): `dist = [0, 4, 1, 3]`
   * Relax 3‚Üí1 (1): `dist = [0, 4, 1, 3]` (no change this time)
3. Repeat relaxation 2 more times ‚Üí no further changes.
4. No negative cycle ‚Üí final result:

   * Shortest distances = `[0, 4, 1, 3]`.

---

## üîπ Complexity

* Time: **O(V¬∑E)** (slower than Dijkstra‚Äôs $O(E \log V)$)
* Space: **O(V)**

---

## üîπ Applications

* Works with **negative weights** (unlike Dijkstra).
* Used in:

  * **Currency arbitrage detection** (negative cycles = arbitrage opportunities).
  * **Routing protocols** (e.g., RIP in networking).
  * **Solving linear difference constraints** in optimization.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
Bellman‚ÄìFord is a **single-source shortest path algorithm** that works with **negative edges** and detects **negative cycles**, but is slower than Dijkstra.

---

Would you like me to also create a **side-by-side comparison: Dijkstra vs. Bellman‚ÄìFord vs. Floyd‚ÄìWarshall** (with use cases)
---
**Bellman‚ÄìFord** and **Dijkstra‚Äôs** are two classic shortest path algorithms, and although they both find the shortest path from a **single source to all vertices**, they differ in important ways.

# üîπ Key Differences: Bellman‚ÄìFord vs. Dijkstra

| Feature             | **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**                         | **Bellman‚ÄìFord Algorithm**                                                 |

| **Complexity**      | $O((V+E)\log V)$ with min-heap (faster).         | $O(V \cdot E)$ (slower).                                                   |

| **Approach**        | Greedy (pick the nearest unexplored node).       | Dynamic Programming (relaxes all edges up to $V-1$ times).                 |
| **Use cases**       | Fast for large graphs with non-negative weights. | Safer when graph may contain negative weights.                             |

# üîπ Code Snippets (Python)

### 1. **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, source):
    # graph = {u: [(v, weight), ...]}
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    dist[source] = 0
    pq = [(0, source)]  # (distance, node)

    while pq:
        current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if current_dist > dist[u]:
            continue
        for v, weight in graph[u]:
            if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))
    
    return dist

# Example (non-negative weights)
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 4), ('C', 1)],
    'B': [('E', 4)],
    'C': [('B', 2), ('D', 4)],
    'D': [('E', 4)],
    'E': []
}
print(dijkstra(graph, 'A'))
```

üëâ Works only if all edge weights are **non-negative**.

---

### 2. **Bellman‚ÄìFord Algorithm**

```python
def bellman_ford(graph, vertices, source):
    # graph = [(u, v, weight), ...]
    dist = {v: float('inf') for v in vertices}
    dist[source] = 0

    # Relax edges V-1 times
    for _ in range(len(vertices) - 1):
        for u, v, w in graph:
            if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w

    # Check for negative weight cycle
    for u, v, w in graph:
        if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
            raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
    
    return dist

# Example (with negative weights but no negative cycle)
vertices = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
graph = [
    ('A', 'B', 1),
    ('B', 'C', 3),
    ('A', 'C', -2),
    ('C', 'D', 2)
]

print(bellman_ford(graph, vertices, 'A'))
```

üëâ Handles **negative weights** and can detect **negative cycles**.

---

# üîπ Intuition with Example

Suppose we have this graph:

```
A --(4)--> B
A --(1)--> C
C --(-2)--> B
```

* **Dijkstra** fails ‚ùå because it assumes once you visit `B` with distance `4`, that‚Äôs the best. But later `C ‚Üí B` with `-2` gives a shorter path (`A ‚Üí C ‚Üí B = -1`).
* **Bellman‚ÄìFord** works ‚úÖ because it keeps relaxing edges multiple times.

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:

* Use **Dijkstra** if weights are **non-negative** and you need speed.
* Use **Bellman‚ÄìFord** if the graph might have **negative weights** or you want to check for **negative cycles**.

---

Would you like me to also show you a **side-by-side dry run on the same graph** (with a negative edge) so you can see exactly how Dijkstra fails but Bellman‚ÄìFord succeeds?
