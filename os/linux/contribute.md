Great question 👍 — contributing to **Git** itself (the version control system written in C) or to the **Linux kernel** (maintained by Linus Torvalds) are two of the most prestigious open-source contributions. Since you specifically mentioned “send pull request to Linus Torvalds,” let’s cover both Git and Linux kernel, and clarify the process.

---

# 🔹 Step 1: Understand What You’re Contributing To

* **Git project** → hosted at [https://github.com/git/git](https://github.com/git/git). Maintainers handle pull requests. Linus *does not* directly manage Git.
* **Linux kernel** → managed at [https://git.kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org). Maintained via mailing lists, patches, and subsystem maintainers. Linus is the final integrator but doesn’t review random PRs — you send patches via email to the mailing list.

---

# 🔹 Step 2: Fork and Clone

If you’re contributing to **Git**:

```bash
# Fork https://github.com/git/git to your GitHub account
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/git.git
cd git
```

For **Linux kernel**:

```bash
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
```

---

# 🔹 Step 3: Create a Branch

Always work on a separate branch:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-doc-typo
```

---

# 🔹 Step 4: Make Changes

Edit code, fix bugs, or update documentation. Example:

```c
printf("Hello Git Contributor!\n");
```

---

# 🔹 Step 5: Commit Properly

Write good commit messages. Git projects follow **conventional, descriptive messages**.

Example:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -s -m "doc: fix typo in usage section"
```

👉 `-s` adds your **Signed-off-by** line, required for both Git and Linux kernel contributions.

---

# 🔹 Step 6: Push and Send PR / Patch

### For **Git (GitHub workflow)**

```bash
git push origin fix-doc-typo
```

Then go to your fork on GitHub and **open a Pull Request** against `git/git`.

Maintainers (like Junio Hamano) will review it. If accepted, it gets merged into Git.

---

### For **Linux Kernel (email workflow)**

You don’t send a GitHub PR to Linus. Instead, you send patches to the **kernel mailing list** (`linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org`) using `git send-email`.

Example:

```bash
git format-patch origin/master --stdout > mypatch.patch
git send-email --to="linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org" mypatch.patch
```

* Patches are reviewed by **subsystem maintainers** (e.g., networking, filesystem).
* If accepted, they eventually flow up to Linus.
* Only **subsystem maintainers** usually interact directly with Linus.

---

# 🔹 Step 7: Be Patient & Follow Etiquette

* Read the project’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `Documentation/` (kernel has `SubmittingPatches` guide).
* Expect feedback and requests to improve your patch.
* Small fixes (typos, doc fixes) are a good first step.

---

# 🔹 Summary

* **Git project** → fork on GitHub → make branch → fix → PR → reviewed by maintainers.
* **Linux kernel** → no GitHub PRs → use `git send-email` → submit patch to mailing list → reviewed by subsystem maintainers → if accepted, Linus pulls it.

👉 Do you want me to show you a **real “hello world” example patch to the Linux kernel** (like fixing a typo in a driver) so you can practice step by step?
