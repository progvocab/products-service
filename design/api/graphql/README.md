# Design of **simple GraphQL endpoint**  

**Use Case**:
Client wants to fetch information about a user and their posts.

---

### 1. **GraphQL Schema**

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

---

### 2. **Query**

```graphql
query {
  getUser(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

 This returns **only the fields requested** (name, email, post titles).

---

### 3. **Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant GraphQLServer as GraphQL Server
    participant DB as Database

    Client->>GraphQLServer: Query { getUser(id: "1") { name, email, posts { title } } }
    GraphQLServer->>DB: Fetch User by ID=1
    DB-->>GraphQLServer: User Data
    GraphQLServer->>DB: Fetch Posts by User ID=1
    DB-->>GraphQLServer: Posts Data
    GraphQLServer-->>Client: { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "posts": [{ "title": "Hello GraphQL" }] }
```

---

###  Setup :

* Client sends **GraphQL query**.
* Server resolves it by fetching from DB (or microservices).
* Only **requested fields** are returned (unlike REST, which might return all fields).

---

## Extend the design to include a **mutation use case**.

---

## 1. **GraphQL Schema with Mutation**

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(userId: ID!, title: String!, content: String!): Post
}
```

---

## 2. **Mutation**

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(userId: "1", title: "New Post", content: "Hello Mutation!") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

 This creates a new post for the user with `id = 1` and returns the newly created postâ€™s ID and title.

---

## 3. **Mutation Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant GraphQLServer as GraphQL Server
    participant DB as Database

    Client->>GraphQLServer: Mutation { createPost(userId: "1", title: "New Post", content: "Hello Mutation!") }
    GraphQLServer->>DB: Insert new Post (userId=1, title, content)
    DB-->>GraphQLServer: Post Created (id=101, title="New Post")
    GraphQLServer-->>Client: { "id": "101", "title": "New Post" }
```

---

### Functionality :

* **Query** â†’ Fetching existing data (like `getUser`).
* **Mutation** â†’ Modifying/creating data (like `createPost`).

---

## **GraphQL Subscription use case**.

---

## 1. **GraphQL Schema with Subscription**

```graphql
type Subscription {
  postCreated: Post
}
```

---

## 2. **Subscription**

```graphql
subscription {
  postCreated {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

This allows clients (e.g., browsers, apps) to get **real-time updates** whenever a new post is created.
Subscriptions usually work over **WebSockets** instead of plain HTTP.

---

## 3. **Subscription Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant GraphQLServer as GraphQL Server
    participant DB as Database
    participant WS as WebSocket Channel

    Client->>GraphQLServer: Subscribe { postCreated { id, title, content } }
    GraphQLServer->>WS: Open WebSocket Connection
    GraphQLServer-->>Client: Subscription Acknowledged (waiting for events)

    GraphQLServer->>DB: Listen for new Post Insert
    DB-->>GraphQLServer: New Post Created (id=202, title="Real-time Post", content="Hello Subscription!")
    GraphQLServer-->>Client: Event via WS { "id": "202", "title": "Real-time Post", "content": "Hello Subscription!" }
```

---

### Functionality :

* Client subscribes once.
* Server keeps a **persistent connection** (WebSocket).
* On new post creation, server **pushes data** to the client instantly.

---
 **GraphQL doesnâ€™t dictate how the data is fetched** â€” itâ€™s just a **query language and execution engine**.

When you implement a GraphQL server (say with Apollo, GraphQL-Java, or HotChocolate in .NET), you write **resolvers** for each field. These resolvers decide how to fetch the data.

So GraphQL can:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Connect Directly to a Database

* If you own the data and have direct DB access.
* Example: `getUser` resolver queries PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

**Flow**:

```
Client â†’ GraphQL Server â†’ Database â†’ Client
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Call Other APIs (REST / gRPC / SOAP / Microservices)

* If the data is in another service (e.g., a Users microservice, Payments API).
* GraphQL acts as an **API Gateway** (aggregation layer).

**Flow**:

```
Client â†’ GraphQL Server â†’ Other APIs â†’ Client
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Hybrid (Most Common in Real Systems)

* Some resolvers fetch data from a **database**.
* Others fetch from **internal/external APIs**.
* GraphQL stitches everything into one response.

**Flow**:

```
Client â†’ GraphQL Server â†’ { DB + APIs + Cache } â†’ Client
```

---

### Example:

* `getUser` â†’ queries DB.
* `getWeather` â†’ calls external Weather API.
* `getOrders` â†’ calls Orders microservice.

---

 **Three integration options** for GraphQL (Direct DB, API calls, Hybrid).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Client
        Q[GraphQL Query]
    end

    subgraph GraphQLServer[GraphQL Server]
        R1[Resolver: getUser]
        R2[Resolver: getWeather]
        R3[Resolver: getOrders]
    end

    subgraph Database
        DB[(User DB)]
    end

    subgraph APIs
        API1[Weather API]
        API2[Orders Microservice]
    end

    Q --> GraphQLServer

    R1 --> DB
    R2 --> API1
    R3 --> API2

    GraphQLServer --> Client
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Explanation:

1. **Direct DB** â†’ `getUser` resolver queries **Database**.
2. **API Call** â†’ `getWeather` resolver calls external **Weather API**.
3. **Hybrid** â†’ `getOrders` resolver calls an **Orders Microservice**.
4. GraphQL **stitches results** into **one JSON response**.

---

Got it âœ… Letâ€™s write a **resolver in AWS AppSync**.

In AppSync, resolvers are written using **Velocity Template Language (VTL)** (for direct data sources like DynamoDB, RDS, Lambda) or mapped to **Lambda functions** (for custom logic).

Iâ€™ll show you both ways:

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Resolver with DynamoDB (Direct Integration)**

Suppose we have a schema:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Request Mapping Template (getUser.req.vtl)**

```vtl
{
  "version": "2018-05-29",
  "operation": "GetItem",
  "key": {
    "id": { "S": "$ctx.args.id" }
  }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Response Mapping Template (getUser.res.vtl)**

```vtl
$util.toJson($ctx.result)
```

âœ… This resolver queries DynamoDB directly and returns the user object.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Resolver with AWS Lambda (Custom Logic)**

If we want to call another API or add custom business logic:

ðŸ“Œ **Schema**

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createPost(userId: ID!, title: String!, content: String!): Post
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Lambda Function (Node.js Example)**

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log("AppSync event:", JSON.stringify(event));

  // Example: create a post in DynamoDB or another API
  const newPost = {
    id: Date.now().toString(),
    title: event.arguments.title,
    content: event.arguments.content,
  };

  // return the new post
  return newPost;
};
```

ðŸ“Œ **Request Mapping Template (createPost.req.vtl)**

```vtl
{
  "version": "2018-05-29",
  "operation": "Invoke",
  "payload": $util.toJson($context)
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Response Mapping Template (createPost.res.vtl)**

```vtl
$util.toJson($ctx.result)
```

âœ… Now AppSync calls Lambda, which can fetch/write data from DBs, REST APIs, or even call external GraphQL.

---

âš¡ So in summary:

* **DynamoDB Resolver** â†’ Pure VTL mapping.
* **Lambda Resolver** â†’ More flexibility (API calls, transformations, business logic).

---



 **AppSync Resolver Flow** for both direct DB and Lambda integration:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Client
        Q[GraphQL Query / Mutation]
    end

    subgraph AppSync[AppSync GraphQL Server]
        R1[Resolver: Direct DynamoDB]
        R2[Resolver: Lambda Function]
    end

    subgraph DynamoDB
        DB[(User Table)]
    end

    subgraph Lambda
        LFn[Custom Logic<br/>API Calls, DB Writes, Business Rules]
    end

    Q --> AppSync
    AppSync --> R1
    AppSync --> R2

    R1 --> DB
    DB --> R1

    R2 --> LFn
    LFn --> R2

    AppSync --> Client
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Explanation:

* Client sends a **GraphQL request** to **AWS AppSync**.
* AppSync chooses the correct **resolver** (based on schema).

  * If **direct DynamoDB**, it executes via VTL mapping.
  * If **Lambda**, AppSync invokes Lambda with request payload.
* The result is transformed (via response mapping template) and returned to the client.
