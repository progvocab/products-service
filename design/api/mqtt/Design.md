# When to choose which (rules of thumb)

* Use **AWS IoT Core with MQTT** when you have many edge devices, mobile or constrained networks, need tiny payloads, low battery usage, and simple pub/sub topics.
* Use **Amazon MSK (Kafka)** for high throughput pipelines, event sourcing, analytics, stream processing, and when you need long retention and strong ordering/partitioning.
* Use **Amazon MQ (ActiveMQ)** when you need JMS compatibility, strict enterprise messaging semantics, SOAP or legacy clients, or transactional queues with broker-managed acknowledgements.

---

# Common integration patterns on AWS

* Bridge IoT to analytics: AWS IoT Core rules can route MQTT messages to Kinesis, Lambda, S3, or MSK for downstream processing.
* Stream processing: MSK producers push events into topics, stream processors like Flink or MSK Connect sink to S3 Redshift or ElasticSearch.
* Enterprise integration: Amazon MQ for JMS clients, connect to Lambda or EC2 consumers, or use connectors to sync with RDS or S3.

# Architecture diagrams

### 1) MQTT on AWS IoT Core for IoT telemetry and control

```mermaid

  DeviceA[Device A]
  DeviceB[Device B]
  IoTCore[AWS IoT Core]
  RuleEngine[IoT Rule Engine]
  LambdaFn[Lambda Consumer]
  KinesisStream[Kinesis Stream]
  DynamoDB[Time Series Store]
  S3[Raw Storage]

  DeviceA -->|publish to topic| IoTCore
  DeviceB -->|publish to topic| IoTCore
  IoTCore --> RuleEngine
  RuleEngine --> LambdaFn
  RuleEngine --> KinesisStream
  RuleEngine --> DynamoDB
  RuleEngine --> S3
  LambdaFn -->|invoke downstream| OtherService[Other Microservice]
```

Notes

* Devices use MQTT or MQTT over WebSocket to connect to AWS IoT Core.
* IoT Rule Engine routes messages to Lambda, Kinesis, S3, DynamoDB, or MSK.
* Use Device Shadows and Jobs in IoT Core for state management and OTA updates.

### 2) Event streaming with Amazon MSK for analytics and ML

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Producers[Producers Microservices]
  MSK[Amazon MSK Cluster]
  StreamProc[Flink or Spark Streaming]
  KafkaConnect[MSK Connect]
  S3[Data Lake S3]
  Redshift[Data Warehouse]
  ES[Elasticsearch]
  Consumers[Stream Consumers]

  Producers -->|produce events| MSK
  MSK --> StreamProc
  StreamProc --> Consumers
  MSK --> KafkaConnect
  KafkaConnect --> S3
  KafkaConnect --> Redshift
  KafkaConnect --> ES
  Consumers -->|read processed events| DownstreamApps[Downstream Apps]
```

Notes

* MSK provides durable, partitioned topics with configurable retention.
* Stream processing computes features and writes back to feature store or other topics.
* Use MSK Connect or Kafka Connect connectors to sink/load to S3 Redshift ElasticSearch etc.

### 3) Enterprise messaging with Amazon MQ using ActiveMQ

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  AppA[Legacy App A]
  AppB[Legacy App B]
  AmazonMQ[Amazon MQ Broker Cluster]
  QueuePayments[Queue Payments]
  TopicAlerts[Topic Alerts]
  ConsumerSvc[Consumer Service]
  LambdaFn[Lambda Processor]
  RDS[Relational DB]

  AppA -->|send JMS message| AmazonMQ
  AppB -->|send JMS message| AmazonMQ
  AmazonMQ --> QueuePayments
  AmazonMQ --> TopicAlerts
  ConsumerSvc -->|consume from queue| QueuePayments
  LambdaFn -->|subscribe to topic| TopicAlerts
  ConsumerSvc --> RDS
```

Notes

* Amazon MQ provides standard protocols like AMQP MQTT OpenWire and supports JMS clients.
* Good when you must support older enterprise clients or require JMS transactions.

---

# Feature and operational tradeoffs

* **Operational complexity**

  * MSK requires cluster planning and Kafka expertise but AWS MSK manages brokers.
  * IoT Core is fully managed and handles millions of devices with built-in auth, device registry.
  * Amazon MQ is managed but still requires broker tuning for high scale.

* **Security**

  * IoT Core integrates with AWS IoT policies, mutual TLS for devices, and AWS Cognito for apps.
  * MSK supports VPC, IAM for MSK APIs, encryption in transit and at rest, and ACLs via Kafka.
  * Amazon MQ supports VPC, TLS, user authentication, and IAM access.

* **Throughput and retention**

  * Kafka excels at very high throughput and long retention windows.
  * MQTT messages are small and optimized for many clients but not for long retention in the broker by default.
  * ActiveMQ is suited for reliable delivery and transactional semantics rather than huge scale retention.

---

# Example decision matrix (short)

* Many constrained devices sending telemetry, need native device management → **AWS IoT Core with MQTT**.
* High volume event streaming, analytics, multiple consumers, long retention → **Amazon MSK**.
* Enterprise systems with JMS clients, transactional queues, and protocol compatibility needs → **Amazon MQ**.

---

If you want, I can:

* Produce sample IaC snippets for each pattern (CloudFormation or Terraform).
* Show how to route IoT Core messages into an MSK topic via an IoT Rule.
* Provide a small producer/consumer code example for each technology.
