Awesome question 👍 — let’s go deep into **Parallel GC** and **Concurrent GC** in Java, since these are two key types of garbage collectors that often confuse people.

---

# 🔹 1. Parallel Garbage Collector

Also called **Throughput Collector** (`-XX:+UseParallelGC`).

* **Goal:** Maximize **throughput** (application work / total time).
* Works with **multiple GC threads** to clean the heap **in parallel**.
* But still **Stop-the-World (STW)**:

  * When GC runs, all application threads (mutators) are paused.

### How it Works

1. Heap is divided into **Young Generation** (Eden + Survivor) and **Old Generation**.
2. When Eden fills → **Minor GC** occurs.

   * Multiple GC threads clear Eden and move survivors.
   * Mutator threads are stopped until collection finishes.
3. When Old Gen fills → **Major GC / Full GC** occurs.

   * Again, all threads stop.
   * Multiple GC threads compact Old Gen.

### Characteristics

* **Parallelism:** GC itself is parallelized (uses multiple CPU cores).
* **Not concurrent:** mutator threads are paused during GC.
* **Best for batch jobs / high-throughput systems** where pauses are tolerable.

### Example JVM Options

```bash
java -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 MyApp
```

* Uses 4 GC threads.
* Still STW during GC, but faster collection compared to Serial GC.

# 🔹 2. Concurrent Garbage Collectors

Examples: **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep, deprecated in Java 9+)**, **G1 GC (default since Java 9)**, **ZGC**, **Shenandoah**.

* **Goal:** Minimize **pause times** (latency).
* Work **concurrently with mutator threads**, so application keeps running during most of the GC.

---

## 🔸 CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) – classic concurrent collector

* Runs alongside application threads.
* Process:

  1. **Initial Mark (STW):** Mark roots.
  2. **Concurrent Mark:** Mark reachable objects while app runs.
  3. **Remark (STW):** Catch up on changes missed during concurrent mark.
  4. **Concurrent Sweep:** Reclaim dead objects.
* Low pause times, but causes **fragmentation** (no compaction).

---

## 🔸 G1 GC (Garbage-First GC, default in Java 9+)

* Heap divided into **many small regions**.
* Collects regions with most garbage first.
* Uses both **parallelism** (multi-threaded GC) and **concurrency** (runs alongside mutators).
* Process:

  * Young GC (parallel, stop-the-world but fast).
  * Concurrent marking of Old Gen.
  * Mixed GCs (collect both Young + some Old regions).
* Predictable pauses (configurable with `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`).

---

## 🔸 ZGC & Shenandoah

* **Ultra-low pause GCs**.
* Pause times are in **milliseconds, independent of heap size**.
* Achieved with:

  * **Colored pointers / forwarding pointers.**
  * **Read barriers** (on object access, fix reference if object moved).
  * Fully concurrent compaction (no long STW pauses).
* Suitable for **large heaps (TBs)** and **real-time systems**.

# 🔹 Parallel vs Concurrent — Key Difference

| Feature           | Parallel GC (Throughput GC)    | Concurrent GCs (CMS, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Parallelism**   | ✅ Yes (GC uses many threads)   | ✅ Yes (GC uses many threads)              |
| **Concurrency**   | ❌ No (mutators stop during GC) | ✅ Yes (GC runs alongside mutators)        |
| **STW Pauses**    | Long (but faster than Serial)  | Short (few ms for concurrent GCs)         |
| **Goal**          | Maximize throughput            | Minimize pause times (low latency)        |
| **Heap Size**     | Small to medium heaps          | Medium to very large heaps (up to TBs)    |
| **Best Use Case** | Batch jobs, background tasks   | Interactive apps, low-latency services    |

# 🔹 Analogy

* **Parallel GC**:
  Like stopping all traffic on a highway, bringing in 10 sweepers, cleaning very fast, then reopening the road. 🚧 Cars wait, but cleaning is quick.

* **Concurrent GC**:
  Like cleaning lanes while traffic is still flowing — sometimes slowing cars briefly (short pauses), but never fully stopping the highway. 🚗

---

# 🔹 Summary

* **Parallel GC**: Multiple GC threads, but **STW** → good for throughput.
* **Concurrent GC (CMS, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah)**: GC + mutators run **together**, small pauses → good for low-latency.

👉 Do you want me to also **draw a timeline diagram** showing how GC and mutator threads interleave in **Parallel GC vs Concurrent GC**?
