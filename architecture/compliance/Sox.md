Great question 👍 — let’s break it down clearly.

# 🔹 What is SOX Compliance?

**SOX** = **Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002** (a U.S. federal law).

* Created after the **Enron, WorldCom** scandals to **protect investors** from fraudulent financial reporting.
* Applies to all **publicly traded companies** in the U.S. (and to some foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges).

### 🎯 Goal:

* Ensure **accuracy, reliability, and integrity** of financial reporting.
* Enforce strong **internal controls** over financial systems.

## 🔑 Key Requirements of SOX

1. **Section 302** – Corporate responsibility for financial reports

   * CEOs and CFOs must personally certify the accuracy of financial statements.

2. **Section 404** – Internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)

   * Companies must document and audit internal controls.
   * IT systems (databases, access controls, logging) are heavily scrutinized.

3. **Section 409** – Real-time disclosures

   * Companies must disclose material changes in financial condition promptly.

4. **Section 802** – Criminal penalties for record tampering

   * Destruction or falsification of records is punishable (up to 20 years prison).

## 🔹 SOX Compliance in IT & Security

SOX heavily affects IT teams because financial data often lives in **ERP, databases, applications**.
Companies must ensure:

* **Access control** – Who can view/modify financial data?
* **Audit trails** – Logging of all access and changes.
* **Data integrity** – No unauthorized modification.
* **Change management** – Code/configuration changes must be tracked.
* **Segregation of duties (SoD)** – No single user should have end-to-end control (e.g., creating + approving transactions).
