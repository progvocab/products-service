## **Internal Caching in Apache Cassandra**  

Cassandra uses **internal caching** mechanisms to optimize read performance and reduce disk I/O. These caches store frequently accessed data in memory, allowing faster query responses. The primary caches in Cassandra are:

1. **Key Cache**
2. **Row Cache**
3. **Counter Cache**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Cache**
- **What it does:**  
  - Caches the location of row keys in SSTables (on disk).  
  - Helps avoid disk seeks when finding which SSTable contains a key.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When a read request comes, Cassandra checks the **Key Cache** first.  
  - If found, it directly fetches the row from the correct SSTable.  
  - If not, it must search Bloom filters and partition indexes in SSTables.  

- **Configuration in `cassandra.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  key_cache_size_in_mb: 100  # Maximum size of Key Cache in MB
  key_cache_save_period: 14400  # Save cache to disk every 4 hours
  ```

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Improves read performance, especially for frequently accessed keys.  
  - Default enabled because it saves a lot of disk seeks.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Row Cache**
- **What it does:**  
  - Caches entire rows in memory.  
  - Helps **avoid disk reads completely** for hot (frequently accessed) rows.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When a query retrieves a row, it is stored in the Row Cache.  
  - If the same row is queried again, it's served directly from memory.  

- **Configuration in `cassandra.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  row_cache_size_in_mb: 200  # Maximum size of Row Cache in MB
  row_cache_save_period: 0  # Do not save cache to disk (default)
  ```

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Boosts performance for **read-heavy workloads**.  
  - Best for use cases where the same rows are frequently accessed.  
  - Not enabled by default because it consumes a lot of memory.  

- **When to use:**  
  - When **a small set of rows is read frequently** (e.g., session data, user profiles).  
  - When **RAM is sufficient** to hold frequently accessed rows.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Counter Cache**
- **What it does:**  
  - Optimizes performance for **counter columns** (used for counting events).  
  - Stores recently used **counter values** to avoid frequent disk reads.  

- **How it works:**  
  - When a counter is updated or read, it is cached.  
  - If accessed again, Cassandra fetches it from the cache instead of disk.  

- **Configuration in `cassandra.yaml`:**
  ```yaml
  counter_cache_size_in_mb: 50  # Max size of Counter Cache
  counter_cache_save_period: 7200  # Save cache to disk every 2 hours
  ```

- **Performance Impact:**  
  - Reduces latency in counter operations.  
  - Improves scalability for real-time analytics with counters.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Caching Mechanisms in Cassandra**
Apart from the built-in caches, Cassandra also relies on:
- **Bloom Filters:**  
  - A probabilistic data structure that quickly tells if a key exists in an SSTable.  
  - Reduces the number of disk reads required.  

- **Page Cache (OS-Level):**  
  - Cassandra leverages the Linux **Page Cache** for faster disk reads.  
  - Frequently accessed SSTable data stays in memory automatically.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Each Cache?**
| **Cache Type** | **Best Use Case** | **Default Enabled?** | **Memory Usage** | **Improves Performance?** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Key Cache** | High read workloads with many unique keys | ‚úÖ Yes | Low | ‚úÖ High |
| **Row Cache** | Read-heavy workloads with repeated row access | ‚ùå No | High | ‚úÖ Very High |
| **Counter Cache** | High update frequency on counters | ‚úÖ Yes | Medium | ‚úÖ Medium |
| **Bloom Filters** | Large datasets with many SSTables | ‚úÖ Yes | Low | ‚úÖ High |

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Tuning Cassandra Caches for Performance**
To optimize caching in Cassandra:
1. **Increase `key_cache_size_in_mb`** if disk seeks are high.  
2. **Enable Row Cache only if repeated row reads are common** (e.g., user sessions).  
3. **Monitor cache hit rates** using:  
   ```cql
   nodetool info
   ```
4. **Use OS Page Cache** by keeping enough free memory.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Key Cache** is essential for **all workloads**.  
- **Row Cache** is useful for **read-heavy applications** with frequent row access.  
- **Counter Cache** improves performance for applications using **counters** (analytics, real-time metrics).  
- **Tuning the cache settings** can significantly **boost read performance** in Cassandra.
