### âœ… What is a Disjoint Set?

A **Disjoint Set** (also known as **Disjoint Set Union â€“ DSU** or **Union-Find**) is a **data structure** that keeps track of a **partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets**.

It supports two efficient operations:

| Operation     | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find(x)`     | Determines the representative (root) of the set containing element `x`. |
| `union(x, y)` | Merges the sets that contain `x` and `y`.                               |

These operations are optimized using:

* **Path Compression** during `find`
* **Union by Rank** or **Union by Size** during `union`

### ðŸ”§ Data Structures Used Internally

| Component            | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parent[]`           | Stores the parent of each element. If `parent[x] == x`, then `x` is a root.                  |
| `rank[]` or `size[]` | Used to optimize unions: keep tree shallow by linking lower rank tree under higher rank one. |

### ðŸ§  Intuition with Example

Given a universe of 5 elements: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`

Initially:

```
parent = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # Each element is its own set
```

After `union(0, 1)`:

```
parent = [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]
```

After `union(1, 2)` (with path compression):

```
parent = [0, 0, 0, 3, 4]
```

Now, `find(2)` returns `0`, which is the representative of the set.

### ðŸ§® Python Code Example

```python
class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            # Path compression
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        px = self.find(x)
        py = self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False  # Already in the same set

        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[px] = py
        elif self.rank[px] > self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[py] = px
        else:
            self.parent[py] = px
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True
```

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Path Compression**     | Flattens the tree for faster future `find()` operations.          |
| **Union by Rank**        | Always attach the shorter tree under the root of the taller tree. |
| **Union by Size**        | Attach the smaller set under the larger one.                      |
| **Connected Components** | Use disjoint sets to group nodes in a graph.                      |
| **Dynamic Connectivity** | Determine if two nodes are connected in a dynamic graph.          |
