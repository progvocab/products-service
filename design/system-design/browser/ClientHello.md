Excellent question — this is a **key negotiation step** in TLS handshakes using **ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral)**.

Let’s go through **how the client and server agree on which elliptic curve to use**, step by step.

---

## 🧩 1. Context: Why They Need to Agree on a Curve

In **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman**, both client and server perform computations on the **same elliptic curve** (e.g., `secp256r1`).

If they used different curves, their public points wouldn’t be compatible — they’d end up with different shared secrets.
So during the handshake, they negotiate *which curve* (also called **Named Group**) to use.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Negotiation Mechanism

### 🔹 Step 1: Client Advertises Supported Curves

In the **ClientHello** message, the client sends:

* A list of **supported cipher suites** (e.g., `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`)
* And an **extension** called **“supported_groups”** (or in older TLS: “elliptic_curves”)

Example (simplified):

```
ClientHello
 ├─ Cipher Suites: [TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, ...]
 └─ Extensions:
     └─ Supported Groups: [secp256r1, secp384r1, x25519, x448]
```

So the client is essentially saying:

> “I can do ECDHE with these curves: P-256, P-384, X25519, etc.”

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Server Picks One

When the server receives the ClientHello:

1. It looks at:

   * The list of **supported groups** from the client
   * Its own **locally supported groups**
2. It picks **one common curve** (highest preference that both support).

Example:

* Client: `[x25519, secp256r1, secp384r1]`
* Server: `[secp256r1, secp521r1]`
* Result: **secp256r1** (common curve)

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Server Announces Its Choice

* In **TLS 1.2**:

  * The server includes its chosen curve inside the `ServerKeyExchange` message along with its ephemeral public key.
  * There’s no explicit “supported_group” response extension — the choice is implied by the curve ID in that message.

* In **TLS 1.3**:

  * The server includes the chosen curve in the `KeyShareEntry` inside its **ServerHello** message:

    ```
    ServerHello
     └─ KeyShareEntry:
         ├─ Group: x25519
         └─ Key Exchange: (server’s ephemeral public key)
    ```

---

## 🧠 3. Example (TLS 1.3 Handshake Simplified)

```
ClientHello
 └─ KeyShareEntries:
     - Group: x25519
       Key: (client ephemeral public key)
     - Group: secp256r1
       Key: (client ephemeral public key)
 └─ Supported Groups: [x25519, secp256r1, secp384r1]

ServerHello
 └─ KeyShareEntry:
     - Group: x25519
       Key: (server ephemeral public key)
```

👉 This means the **server chose x25519** from the client’s list.

---

## 🔐 4. Why This Step Matters

* Ensures **both parties use the same mathematical curve** for ECDHE.
* Prevents downgrade attacks — the handshake is signed and verified, so an attacker can’t force a weaker curve.
* Different curves offer different levels of performance and security:

  * **secp256r1 (P-256)**: widely supported
  * **x25519**: modern, faster, safer against side-channel attacks
  * **secp384r1**, **x448**: stronger but slower

## ✅ 5. Summary Table

| Step | Who    | What Happens                         | Message                                                  |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Client | Sends supported curves               | `ClientHello (supported_groups)`                         |
| 2    | Server | Picks one common curve               | Internal decision                                        |
| 3    | Server | Announces chosen curve               | `ServerKeyExchange` (TLS 1.2) or `ServerHello` (TLS 1.3) |
| 4    | Both   | Use that curve for ECDHE computation | Ephemeral key generation                                 |

Would you like me to show a **diagram of the curve negotiation process** for TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3? It’s a great way to visualize how this exchange actually happens during the handshake.
