Great question 👍 — the word **“parameters”** gets used in different contexts in machine learning (ML), and it can be confusing because it doesn’t always mean the same thing. Let’s go step by step and classify all the main types.

# 🔎 Types of Parameters in Machine Learning

## 1. **Model Parameters**

* **Definition:** Internal variables learned from training data.
* **Examples:**

  * Weights and biases in neural networks.
  * Coefficients in linear regression.
  * Splits in decision trees.
* **How they are set:** Learned during **training** via optimization (e.g., gradient descent).
* **Role:** Define how the model maps inputs → outputs.
* **Persistence:** Saved with the trained model and used during inference.

---

## 2. **Hyperparameters**

* **Definition:** External configurations that control the learning process, not learned by the model.
* **Examples:**

  * Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs.
  * Number of hidden layers, dropout rate.
  * `k` in KNN, `C` in SVM, tree depth in random forest.
* **How they are set:** Chosen manually, via search (grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization).
* **Role:** Control **model complexity**, convergence speed, and generalization.
* **Persistence:** Not learned, but need to be logged for reproducibility.

---

## 3. **Input Parameters (Features)**

* **Definition:** The values given to the model as input (a.k.a. features).
* **Examples:**

  * Height, weight, and age for predicting health risks.
  * Pixel intensities in an image.
  * Words/embeddings in NLP.
* **How they are set:** Defined by the dataset and feature engineering pipeline.
* **Role:** Directly affect the model’s prediction quality.

---

## 4. **Inference Parameters**

* **Definition:** Parameters that affect the behavior of the model **at prediction time** but do not change learned weights.
* **Examples:**

  * **Temperature** (in language models): controls randomness of output distribution.
  * **Top-k / Top-p (nucleus sampling):** controls diversity of generated text.
  * **Batch size** during inference (affects speed, not model behavior).
  * **Thresholds** in classification (e.g., converting probability → label).
* **Role:** Fine-tune model outputs depending on use case (deterministic vs creative, high-precision vs high-recall).

---

## 5. **Training Parameters (Optimization Settings)**

* **Definition:** Parameters that configure the **training process itself** (not the model).
* **Examples:**

  * Optimizer type (SGD, Adam).
  * Learning rate schedule.
  * Gradient clipping value.
* **Role:** Ensure stable and efficient training.
* **Persistence:** Often part of training script but not stored in final model.

---

## 6. **Evaluation Parameters**

* **Definition:** Configurations used when assessing the model’s performance.
* **Examples:**

  * Metrics chosen (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC).
  * Validation split ratio (e.g., 80/20).
  * Cross-validation folds.
* **Role:** Control how well we estimate generalization ability.

---

## 7. **System / Deployment Parameters**

* **Definition:** Parameters that govern how a model is deployed and runs in production.
* **Examples:**

  * Batch size for inference.
  * Number of worker threads, GPU memory limits.
  * Request timeout in serving layer.
* **Role:** Performance, scalability, cost optimization.

---

## 8. **Regularization Parameters**

* **Definition:** Hyperparameters specifically for controlling overfitting.
* **Examples:**

  * L1/L2 penalty weights (`lambda` in ridge/lasso regression).
  * Dropout rate in neural networks.
* **Role:** Encourage simpler models that generalize better.

✅ **Key takeaway:**

* **Parameters** = learned from data.
* **Hyperparameters** = chosen before training.
* **Inference parameters** = chosen at prediction time.
* **Others** (training, evaluation, deployment) define *how* models are trained, tested, or deployed, not what they learn.

Would you like me to also show **a concrete example with logistic regression**, showing which variables fall into each parameter category (weights, learning rate, regularization, etc.)?
