you can write a **very compact (but inefficient and hard to read)** version of Bubble Sort in a single line using Python list comprehensions and loops, but keep in mind: this is more of a *code golf* or fun challenge — **not recommended for production use**.

---

### 🧪 One-liner Bubble Sort (In-place version):

```python
[nums:=nums if all(nums[i] <= nums[i+1] or (nums[i], nums[i+1]:=(nums[i+1], nums[i])) for i in range(len(nums)-1)) else nums for _ in range(len(nums))]
```

### 🧾 Example Usage:

```python
nums = [5, 3, 8, 2, 1]
[nums:=nums if all(nums[i] <= nums[i+1] or (nums[i], nums[i+1]:=(nums[i+1], nums[i])) for i in range(len(nums)-1)) else nums for _ in range(len(nums))]
print(nums)
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* This uses the **walrus operator `:=`** introduced in Python 3.8.
* The swapping happens via tuple unpacking: `(a, b) = (b, a)`.
* It relies on multiple passes (`for _ in range(n)`) to simulate the full bubble sort.
* This is very **hard to maintain and debug**, and offers **no performance benefits**.

Would you like the same kind of one-liner for **insertion sort**, or maybe a more readable, optimized version of bubble sort instead?
