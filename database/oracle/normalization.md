Got it — you want a full, **clear progressive flow** from **Unnormalized** to **6NF**,  
**step-by-step** showing how tables **change** as we fix normalization issues.

Let’s do it properly:

---

# **Given Columns initially**
- Employee Name
- Salary
- City
- Zip Code
- Reportees (Alex | Jenny)  *(multi-valued)*
- Designation
- Grade
- Project ID
- Project Role

---

# **0. UNNORMALIZED FORM (UNF)**  
- **Problems:** Repeating values (Reportees), Multi-valued attributes.

| Employee Name | Salary | City    | Zip | Reportees     | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------|:----|:--------------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York|10001| Alex \| Jenny | Manager     | A     | P1         | Lead         |

---
# **1. FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Atomic values only (no multiple reportees in one cell).
- Split reportees into separate rows.

| Employee Name | Salary | City    | Zip  | Reportee | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------|:-----|:---------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York|10001 | Alex     | Manager     | A     | P1         | Lead         |
| Bob           | 1000   | New York|10001 | Jenny    | Manager     | A     | P1         | Lead         |

---
# **2. SECOND NORMAL FORM (2NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Remove partial dependency on composite key.
- Assume `Employee Name + Project ID` was the composite key — separate project info.

### Split into two tables:

**Employee Table**

| Employee Name | Salary | City    | Zip  | Reportee | Designation | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------|:-----|:---------|:------------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York|10001 | Alex     | Manager     | A     |
| Bob           | 1000   | New York|10001 | Jenny    | Manager     | A     |

**Project Table**

| Project ID | Project Role |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| P1         | Lead         |

---
# **3. THIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Remove transitive dependencies.  
- **City depends on Zip Code**.
- **Designation depends on Grade**.

### Create lookup tables:

**Employee Table**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip  | Reportee | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   |10001 | Alex     | A     |
| Bob           | 1000   |10001 | Jenny    | A     |

**Zip Code Table**

| Zip  | City    |
|:-----|:--------|
|10001 | New York|

**Grade Table**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A     | Manager     |

**Project Table**

| Project ID | Project Role |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| P1         | Lead         |

---
# **4. BOYCE-CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Stronger version of 3NF. Every determinant must be a candidate key.
- Assume Grade → Designation is already fine (single dependency).

**No extra changes needed if above decomposition is correct.**

---
# **5. FOURTH NORMAL FORM (4NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- No multi-valued dependencies.

**Problem in 1NF:**  
Employee had **multiple Reportees** + **multiple Projects**.

Thus, split reportees and projects separately if needed.

Example:

**Employee-Reportee Table**

| Employee Name | Reportee |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Bob           | Alex     |
| Bob           | Jenny    |

**Employee-Project Table**

| Employee Name | Project ID |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| Bob           | P1         |

---
# **6. FIFTH NORMAL FORM (5NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Remove join dependency anomalies.  
- If Employee-Project and Employee-Role relationships are independent, further splitting is needed.

Thus:

**Employee Table**

| Employee Name | Zip | Grade |
|:--------------|:----|:------|
| Bob           |10001| A     |

**Employee-Project Table**

| Employee Name | Project ID |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| Bob           | P1         |

**Employee-Reportee Table**

| Employee Name | Reportee |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Bob           | Alex     |
| Bob           | Jenny    |

**Project Table**

| Project ID | Project Role |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| P1         | Lead         |

**Zip Code Table**

| Zip  | City    |
|:-----|:--------|
|10001 | New York|

**Grade Table**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A     | Manager     |

---
# **7. SIXTH NORMAL FORM (6NF)**  
**Fix:**  
- Decompose tables by **time-varying** attributes individually.

Example: Bob’s salary and grade may change at different times.

Split into Time-Stamped Tables:

**Employee-Grade History Table**

| Employee Name | Grade | Valid_From | Valid_To |
|:--------------|:------|:------------|:---------|
| Bob           | A     | 2024-01-01  | 2025-01-01 |

**Employee-Salary History Table**

| Employee Name | Salary | Valid_From | Valid_To |
|:--------------|:-------|:------------|:---------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 2024-01-01  | 2024-06-01 |
| Bob           | 1200   | 2024-06-01  | 2025-01-01 |

**Employee-Zip History Table**

| Employee Name | Zip | Valid_From | Valid_To |
|:--------------|:----|:------------|:---------|
| Bob           |10001|2024-01-01   | 2025-01-01 |

**Employee-Project Assignment Table (if time-varying)**

| Employee Name | Project ID | Valid_From | Valid_To |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|
| Bob           | P1         |2024-01-01  |2025-01-01|

---
# **Summary of Transformations**

| Normalization Step | Main Action |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| Unnormalized Form | Multiple values in single columns |
| 1NF | Atomic values only |
| 2NF | Remove partial dependencies |
| 3NF | Remove transitive dependencies |
| BCNF | Stronger 3NF (every determinant is a key) |
| 4NF | Remove multi-valued dependencies |
| 5NF | Remove join dependency anomalies |
| 6NF | Full decomposition of temporal data |

---

Would you also like a **diagrammatic flow** (kind of ERD at each stage)?  
I can prepare that too if you want!  
**Would you like me to show it?** (It will be even easier to understand!)


Alright, let's go deep into **database normalization**!

You gave me these sample columns and data:

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

Now, let's **apply all 6 Normal Forms** step by step:

---

# 1. **Unnormalized Form (UNF)**

- Raw table (repeating groups allowed)
- Reportees are not atomic (they are "Alex | Jenny" — multi-valued)

**Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportees       | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex \| Jenny    | Manager     |

---

# 2. **First Normal Form (1NF)**

- **Atomic values only**.
- **No multi-valued attributes**.

**Fix:** Split reportees into multiple rows (or another table).

**Table (Option 1: Multiple Rows):**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Reportee | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Alex     | Manager     |
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Jenny    | Manager     |

**OR (Option 2: Create a separate Reportees Table):**

**Employees Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | Manager     |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

# 3. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

- **Already in 1NF**
- **No partial dependency** on part of a composite key.

Since the primary key is just Employee Name (single field) or Employee ID if added, **and all non-key columns depend entirely** on it, **this satisfies 2NF**.

Nothing changes here.

---

# 4. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

- **No transitive dependencies** (i.e., non-key attribute → another non-key attribute).

**Possible Issue:**  
City may imply some attributes like State or Country (not given now). If city determines another attribute (e.g., state), split it.

**Otherwise**, current schema looks OK for 3NF.

---

# 5. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

- Stricter version of 3NF.
- Every determinant must be a candidate key.

Here, `Employee Name` uniquely identifies salary, city, designation, so no problem.

If `Designation` determines `Salary` (say all Managers always have salary 1000), we'd need to **separate Designation-Salary**:

**Designation Table (if needed):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

Then Employee Table:

| Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| Bob           | New York | Manager     |

---

# 6. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- Deals with **multi-valued dependencies**.

**Problem:**  
Bob has **multiple reportees** independently.  
We already fixed this by creating a separate **Reportees Table** in 1NF.

Thus, 4NF is **already achieved**.

---

# 7. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- **Join dependency** — no lossless join issues.

Since we split Reportees properly, and there's no weird multi-table dependencies, it's fine.

If a complex relationship (e.g., Managers to Departments and Locations separately) existed, we'd split further.

---

# 8. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)** _(rarely used, but for completeness)_

- Decompose into **irreducible** tables based on time-variability.
- Used in temporal databases.

If Bob’s **Salary** changes over time, or **Designation** changes over time, you'd **timestamp** them:

**Employee Salary History Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| Bob           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

Similarly for Designation.

---

# **Summary Table**

| Normal Form | Action Taken |
|:------------|:-------------|
| UNF         | Original data with multi-values |
| 1NF         | Atomic fields (split reportees) |
| 2NF         | All non-key fields depend on the whole key |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency |
| BCNF        | No dependency anomalies |
| 4NF         | No multi-valued dependencies |
| 5NF         | No join dependencies |
| 6NF         | Temporal decomposition if needed |

---

# **Final Structure**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | City     | Designation |
|:------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------|
| 1           | Bob           | New York | Manager     |

**Salary History Table:**

| Employee ID | Salary | Start Date | End Date |
|:------------|:-------|:-----------|:---------|
| 1           | 1000   | 2020-01-01 | 2021-01-01 |
| 1           | 1200   | 2021-01-02 | NULL       |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

**Designation Table (Optional):**

| Designation | Base Salary |
|:------------|:------------|
| Manager     | 1000        |

---

# **Quick Visual**
```plaintext
Employee ---> Reportees (1:N)
Employee ---> SalaryHistory (1:N)
Employee ---> Designation (N:1)
```

---

Would you also like me to create an **ER Diagram** and **SQL script** for this normalized structure?  
(so you can directly visualize and implement it!)  
Let me know!  
It'll be very neat!

Good update!  
You added two new columns:

- **Zip Code**
- **Grade** (where Designation depends on Grade)

Now **dependencies** have become richer. Let’s rework **normalization** step-by-step.

---

# **New Table (Unnormalized / Raw Form)**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Reportees | Designation | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:------------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Alex\|Jenny | Manager     | A1   |

---

# **New Observations:**

- **City depends on Zip Code** (Zip → City)
- **Designation depends on Grade** (Grade → Designation)
- **Reportees** are multi-valued (Alex\|Jenny)
  
---

# **Normalization Steps**

## 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)** — Atomic Columns

**Problem:** Reportees column is multi-valued ("Alex | Jenny").  
**Fix:** Split reportees into a **separate table**.

---
**Employee Table (1NF):**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1   |

**Reportees Table:**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)** — Full Dependency on Key

Since the Employee table now uses **Employee ID** as Primary Key,  
each column depends entirely on Employee ID — no partial dependency.

No additional changes needed here.

---

## 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)** — No Transitive Dependencies

Now:

- `Zip Code` determines `City`
- `Grade` determines `Designation`

> This means **City** and **Designation** should be **moved into separate tables**, to remove transitive dependencies.

---

**New Structure for 3NF:**

**Employee Table:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| 1           | Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A1    |

---

**Zip Code Table:**

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |

---

**Grade Table:**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A1    | Manager     |

---

**Reportees Table (unchanged):**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |
|:-----------|:--------------|
| 1          | Alex          |
| 1          | Jenny         |

---

## 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

Every determinant must be a candidate key.  
✅ `Zip Code` uniquely determines `City`.  
✅ `Grade` uniquely determines `Designation`.

Hence after the above split, **BCNF is achieved**.

---

## 5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

- No multi-valued dependency.
- Reportees are in a different table → good.
- No other multi-valued dependencies.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

- No complex join dependencies.
- We have broken down the database logically.

✅ Achieved.

---

## 7. **Sixth Normal Form (6NF)**

- Handle temporal data separately.
- If **Salary** or **Grade** or **Zip Code** changes over time, maintain a **history table**.

(Usually optional unless handling time-variant data)

---

# **Final Database Structure after Full Normalization**

### **Employee Table**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|

### **Zip Code Table**

| Zip Code | City |

### **Grade Table**

| Grade | Designation |

### **Reportees Table**

| Manager ID | Reportee Name |

---

# **Dependencies (Functional Dependencies)**

| Dependency               | Meaning                     |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Zip Code → City           | Zip uniquely identifies City |
| Grade → Designation       | Grade uniquely identifies Designation |
| Employee ID → Salary, Zip, Grade, Name | Employee uniquely identifies other info |

---

# **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**

```
Employee (EmployeeID) 
    --> ZipCode (ZipCode) --> City
    --> Grade (Grade) --> Designation
    --> Reportees (ManagerID -> ReporteeName)
```

---

# **Summary of Changes due to New Columns:**

| Aspect           | Change made |
|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Multi-valued reportees | Split into separate Reportees table |
| Transitive dependency ZipCode → City | Moved City to separate ZipCode Table |
| Transitive dependency Grade → Designation | Moved Designation to separate Grade Table |
| Dependency simplification | Employee ID links all pieces of data cleanly |

---

# **Would you like me to also create:**

- SQL Scripts?
- Insert sample data?
- Show how queries would look after normalization?
- Show a Spring Data JPA Repository model for this?

It will give a full practical feel!  
Shall I continue? (it’ll be beautiful and very clear!)  
Let me know!
Perfect — let's do this carefully.

You asked to **add** two columns to the existing table:  
- **Project ID**  
- **Project Role**

And then **show the changes** for **all 6 normal forms** (1NF → 6NF).

I'll **start from your previous table**:

---

# **Initial Table (Before Normalization)**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Reportees      | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:---------------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Alex \| Jenny | Manager     | A     | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | -              | Developer   | B     | P102       | Developer    |

- **Problems:**  
  - Reportees column is **multi-valued** ("Alex | Jenny").  
  - **City** depends on **Zip Code** (not Employee Name).
  - **Designation** depends on **Grade**.
  - **Partial dependency** possible if `(Employee Name, Project ID)` is a composite key.

---

# **Normalization step-by-step**

---

## **1NF — Remove multi-valued columns, atomic values only**

### Changes:
- Split reportees into separate rows or a new table.
- Keep each field atomic.

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Designation | Grade | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------------|:------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | Manager     | A     | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | Developer   | B     | P102       | Developer    |

Separate **Reportees** into a new table:

| Manager Name | Reportee Name |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Bob          | Alex          |
| Bob          | Jenny         |

---

## **2NF — Remove partial dependency**

Assuming **composite key** `(Employee Name, Project ID)`:
- Salary, City, Zip Code, Grade, Designation depend **only** on Employee Name → **Partial dependency**.

### Changes:
**Split into two tables**:

**Employee Table:**

| Employee Name | Salary | City     | Zip Code | Grade | Designation |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:---------|:------|:------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | New York | 10001    | A     | Manager     |
| Alice         | 1200   | Boston   | 02101    | B     | Developer   |

**Employee Project Table:**

| Employee Name | Project ID | Project Role |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Bob           | P101       | Lead         |
| Alice         | P102       | Developer    |

---

## **3NF — Remove transitive dependency**

- City depends on Zip Code → Transitive dependency via Zip Code.
- Designation depends on Grade → Transitive dependency via Grade.

### Changes:
Create lookup tables.

**ZipCode Table:**

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |
| 02101    | Boston   |

**Grade Table:**

| Grade | Designation |
|:------|:------------|
| A     | Manager     |
| B     | Developer   |

**Now Employee Table becomes:**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

(Notice: no direct City or Designation here — only references!)

---

## **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**

- Every determinant must be a candidate key.
-  
**Already achieved** because:
  - Employee Name is primary key for Employee.
  - Zip Code is primary key for ZipCode Table.
  - Grade is primary key for Grade Table.

---

## **4NF — Remove multi-valued dependencies**

- No independent multi-valued facts in same table.
-  
**Already achieved**, because:
  - Reportees are separated into a different table.

---

## **5NF — Remove join dependencies**

- Decompose tables further if needed, to avoid lossless joins.
-  
In this simple case, **5NF is achieved**.  
(Real cases arise when one fact depends on multiple joins.)

---

## **6NF — Table decomposed to irreducible form (theoretical)**

- Fully decomposed into smallest meaningful parts.
- Useful mainly in Temporal Databases (versioned records).
-  
**Not necessary** here unless you introduce **time-based changes** to salaries, projects, etc.

---

# **Summary of New Tables**

### 1. Employee Table

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

### 2. ZipCode Table

| Zip Code | City     |
|:---------|:---------|
| 10001    | New York |
| 02101    | Boston   |

### 3. Grade Table

---

# **Visual Diagram**

If you'd like, I can also draw a **simple ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** showing the relations (like One-to-Many, Foreign Keys) —  
Would you like me to do that too?  
It'll be very easy to understand at a glance!  
**(Should I draw it?)**

Alright — let’s **deliberately add new columns** to the **Employee table** that will cause **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** violations.  
Then, I'll show you **what needs to be fixed**.

---

# **Current Clean Employee Table (after 3NF)**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     |

---

# **Now, let's add some problematic columns**

Let's add these two columns:

- **Manager Name** → (who the employee reports to)  
- **Office Location** → (depends on Zip Code)

Updated table:

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade | Manager Name | Office Location |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|:-------------|:----------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     | John         | New York, 5th Ave |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     | Steve        | Boston, Main St  |

---

# **Where is the problem now?**

- **Manager Name** may not uniquely depend on Employee Name (in some orgs, multiple employees have same manager).  
- **Office Location** depends **only on Zip Code**, not on Employee Name directly.

**Thus, not all determinants are candidate keys!**  
This **violates BCNF**.

---

# **BCNF requires:**
> "For every functional dependency X → Y, X must be a superkey."

Currently:
- `Zip Code → Office Location`  
- `Employee Name → Salary, Zip Code, Grade, Manager Name`

Here, **Zip Code** is **not a superkey** in Employee Table.  
(So we violate BCNF.)

---

# **How to Fix This? (BCNF solution)**

### 1. Move Office Location to a new table:

**Zip Code Table:**

| Zip Code | Office Location  |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| 10001    | New York, 5th Ave |
| 02101    | Boston, Main St   |

Employee table keeps only Zip Code (as Foreign Key).

---

### 2. Fix Manager Relationship

Manager relationship could be moved to **Manager Table**:

| Manager Name | Department (or ID) |
|:-------------|:-------------------|
| John         | Sales               |
| Steve        | Tech                |

And link employees via Manager ID, **NOT** store Manager Name directly (otherwise redundancy if manager info changes).

(Or a self-referencing FK if employees themselves are managers.)

---

# **Final Clean Tables after BCNF Fixes**

### **Employee Table**

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade | Manager Name |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|:-------------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 10001    | A     | John         |
| Alice         | 1200   | 02101    | B     | Steve        |

(Manager Name could still be normalized further if needed.)

---

### **Zip Code Table**

| Zip Code | Office Location  |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| 10001    | New York, 5th Ave |
| 02101    | Boston, Main St   |

---

### **Optional: Manager Table**

| Manager Name | Department |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| John         | Sales      |
| Steve        | Tech       |

---

# **In short:**

| What We Added         | What Happened          | How To Fix            |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
| Office Location        | Depends only on Zip Code, not Employee Name | Move to separate ZipCode table |
| Manager Name           | Might cause redundancy, not normalized | Optionally create Manager table |

---

# **Summary**
Adding "Manager Name" and "Office Location" introduced functional dependencies where a non-candidate attribute determined another non-prime attribute — exactly what BCNF forbids!

We **fixed it** by **splitting the tables** based on those dependencies.

---

Would you like me to also show a **small ER diagram** after these changes?  
(Visual makes this much clearer!)  
**Shall I draw it?**


**Good question!**  
Yes, we **can add a column** to the Employee table that **violates 4NF**.

Let’s first very quickly understand:

---

# **What is 4NF?**
- **4NF (Fourth Normal Form)** deals with **multi-valued dependencies (MVDs)**.
- It says:  
> If a table has two or more independent multivalued facts about an entity, they must be separated.

---
# **How to Violate 4NF**

Right now, in Employee table we have:

| Employee Name | Salary | Zip Code | Grade | Manager Name |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------|:------|:-------------|

Let's **add two new multivalued attributes**:

- **Employee Skills** (example: Bob knows "Java" and "Python")  
- **Employee Projects** (example: Bob works on "Apollo" and "Zeus")

Thus, Bob has:
- 2 Skills
- 2 Projects

**Skills and Projects are independent of each other**, but both belong to Bob.

---

# **Sample Bad Table after adding Skills and Projects**

| Employee Name | Skill  | Project |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------|
| Bob           | Java   | Apollo  |
| Bob           | Java   | Zeus    |
| Bob           | Python | Apollo  |
| Bob           | Python | Zeus    |

> See the **combinatorial explosion**? 2 skills × 2 projects = 4 rows.

This redundancy is a **4NF violation**.

---

# **Why is this a problem?**

- Skills and Projects are **independent facts**.
- Storing them **together** causes **unnecessary cartesian product**.
- If Bob gets a new skill, you need to insert new rows unnecessarily for each project.

---

# **How to Fix It (Achieving 4NF)**

We should **split** the table into two independent tables:

### 1. Employee Skills Table

| Employee Name | Skill  |
|:--------------|:-------|
| Bob           | Java   |
| Bob           | Python |

---

### 2. Employee Projects Table

| Employee Name | Project |
|:--------------|:--------|
| Bob           | Apollo  |
| Bob           | Zeus    |

---

Thus, **no unnecessary duplication** now.

---

# **Summary**

| Concept         | Explanation |
|:----------------|:------------|
| Violation       | Added Skills and Projects columns into Employee, causing multi-valued dependency |
| Why it Violates | Skills and Projects are independent facts, causing cartesian product |
| How to Fix      | Split into two separate tables: EmployeeSkills and EmployeeProjects |
| 4NF Goal        | No table should have more than one independent multivalued dependency |

---

# **In short:**  
Yes, by adding **Skills** and **Projects** columns, **4NF** is violated.  
**4NF requires** that we **separate** them into different tables.

---

Would you like me to also show you:
- **How 5NF** can be violated with more complex relations (like skill per project)?
- or maybe a **full ER diagram** for Employee after fixing 4NF?

It'll be very visual and interesting if you want!  
**Shall I proceed?**


Perfect, you're thinking really deeply about normalization — let's go next level!

---

# **Quick Recap: What is 5NF (Fifth Normal Form)?**
- 5NF is also called **Project-Join Normal Form** (PJNF).
- It deals with **joining** tables **without creating wrong data**.
- It **eliminates complex join dependencies**.
- It happens when a table can be broken down into **three or more** tables, but joining them causes **redundant data** unless normalized properly.

---
# **How to Violate 5NF?**

We need **three independent relationships** between entities.

Let’s **add these new columns** to the Employee table:

| Column Name   | Example Values   |
|:--------------|:-----------------|
| Project ID    | Apollo, Zeus      |
| Skill         | Java, Python      |
| Certification | AWS Certified, Oracle Certified |

---

# **Example of Data (Before 5NF):**

| Employee Name | Project  | Skill  | Certification    |
|:--------------|:---------|:-------|:-----------------|
| Bob           | Apollo   | Java   | AWS Certified    |
| Bob           | Apollo   | Java   | Oracle Certified |
| Bob           | Zeus     | Java   | AWS Certified    |
| Bob           | Zeus     | Java   | Oracle Certified |
| Bob           | Apollo   | Python | AWS Certified    |
| Bob           | Apollo   | Python | Oracle Certified |
| Bob           | Zeus     | Python | AWS Certified    |
| Bob           | Zeus     | Python | Oracle Certified |

> **8 rows!** Explosion of rows even though the relationships are independent.

---
# **Problem:**
- Project ↔ Skill
- Project ↔ Certification
- Skill ↔ Certification  
All are **independent relations**, but putting them together causes **huge duplication**.

---

# **Why This is a 5NF Violation?**
- The table **cannot be reconstructed** correctly by simply joining smaller subsets unless you carefully manage **triplet dependencies**.
- Too much redundancy and risks of incorrect joins.
  
---

# **How to Fix 5NF Violation**

We **split** the table into **3 tables**:

| Employee Name | Project  |
|:--------------|:---------|
| Bob           | Apollo   |
| Bob           | Zeus     |

| Employee Name | Skill  |
|:--------------|:-------|
| Bob           | Java   |
| Bob           | Python |

| Employee Name | Certification    |
|:--------------|:-----------------|
| Bob           | AWS Certified    |
| Bob           | Oracle Certified |

> Now the relationships are **independent** and **joinable** without redundancy!

---
# **Summary Table**

| Concept              | Explanation |
|:---------------------|:------------|
| 5NF Goal              | Eliminate redundancy caused by multi-join dependencies |
| 5NF Violation         | Project, Skill, Certification stored together |
| Result                | Huge cartesian product (8 rows for 2x2x2 combinations) |
| How to Fix            | Split into 3 independent tables |
| Keyword               | Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF) |

---

# **Visualization**

- In 4NF, we solve **multivalued dependencies**.
- In 5NF, we solve **multi-table join dependencies**.

---

# **Extra Tip:**  
- 5NF violations are **rare** in practical applications because designing tables this complex is unusual without deep business needs (like complex skill, cert, project matching in large enterprises).

---

# **Do you want me to also show an example:**
- how **joining wrongly** creates **incorrect employee records**?
- or **how to design a microservice schema** for Employee, Project, Skills with proper 5NF separation?

It'll make it super practical.  
**Shall I proceed with that?**



Awesome — you are going really deep!  
**Let’s now go into 6NF (Sixth Normal Form)** — the ultimate normalization level!

---

# **What is 6NF (Sixth Normal Form)?**

| Concept | Meaning |
|:--------|:--------|
| 6NF is about **decomposing** tables **as much as possible**. |
| Each table stores **only atomic facts** (no time-varying data mixed together). |
| Focuses heavily on **temporal databases** (data that changes over time). |
| Every **non-trivial join dependency** must be a consequence of candidate keys. |
| **Introduced officially by:** Christopher Date, Fabian Pascal |

---

# **When does 6NF become important?**
- If data changes **independently across columns over time**.
- Especially needed for:
  - **Versioned systems** (historical records)
  - **Temporal databases**
  - **Data warehouses**  
- It helps track **fine-grained changes** without updating the whole row.

---

# **How to Violate 6NF?**

Suppose our Employee table is:

| Employee Name | City    | Zip Code | Designation | Salary | Project | Grade | Updated Date |
|:--------------|:--------|:---------|:------------|:-------|:--------|:------|:-------------|
| Bob           | New York| 10001    | Manager     | 1000   | Apollo  | A     | 2024-01-01   |

**Problem:**  
- If Bob's **Salary** changes but **City** doesn't change, you still have to update the entire row.
- You cannot track changes independently at field level.

Thus, **columns that change at different rates** should be split into separate tables.

---

# **What would 6NF do?**

**Split** every **time-varying attribute** into **its own table**:

| Table                | Columns |
|:---------------------|:--------|
| Employee_Name_City    | (Employee Name, City, Zip Code, Valid_From, Valid_To) |
| Employee_Name_Designation | (Employee Name, Designation, Grade, Valid_From, Valid_To) |
| Employee_Name_Salary  | (Employee Name, Salary, Valid_From, Valid_To) |
| Employee_Name_Project | (Employee Name, Project, Valid_From, Valid_To) |

> **Each table tracks only one fact over time!**

---

# **Example of Decomposed Tables**

### Employee_Name_City
| Employee Name | City    | Zip Code | Valid_From | Valid_To   |
|:--------------|:--------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Bob           | New York| 10001    | 2024-01-01 | 2025-01-01 |

---

### Employee_Name_Salary
| Employee Name | Salary | Valid_From | Valid_To   |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
| Bob           | 1000   | 2024-01-01 | 2024-07-01 |
| Bob           | 1200   | 2024-07-01 | 2025-01-01 |

---

# **Summary Table**

| Concept              |  |
|:---------------------|:--|
| **6NF Focus**         | Full atomic decomposition + time-varying data |
| **Problem Solved**    | Columns changing independently without redundant updates |
| **Common Usage**      | Temporal databases, Historical systems, Slowly Changing Dimensions |
| **Storage Complexity**| Very High (too many small tables) |
| **When to use**       | Complex auditing or when column changes must be versioned independently |

---

# **Real Life Example Use Cases for 6NF**

- **Insurance Policy Changes** (Customer Address vs Premium vs Status changes independently)
- **Employee Payroll** (only salary changes, not department)
- **IoT Sensor Data** (temperature vs humidity vs battery — all updating differently)

---

# **Design Patterns Related**
- **Event Sourcing** — Save every event (change) separately.
- **Temporal Pattern** — Historical version tracking.
- **Immutable Data Storage** — Never overwrite; only add new versions.

---

# **Visualization**

In 5NF  
> You prevent *join redundancy*.

In 6NF  
> You even prevent *column update redundancy*.

---

# **In short:**

> 6NF = Ultra Fine-grained Tables + Time History Tracking

---

# **Would you like me to continue and show:**
- How this affects Microservices data design (especially for temporal microservices)?  
- A Spring Data + MongoDB style example for 6NF modeling?

It would be really cool! Want me to continue?  **(Shall I?)**
