The `jdk.internal` packages (and more generally ‚ÄúJDK internal APIs‚Äù) refer to classes and packages that are part of the *internal implementation* of the JDK but are **not intended for public use** by applications. They provide internal utilities, support, hooks, runtime services, etc., used by the JDK itself (e.g. in `java.base`, `java.lang`, `java.nio`, `java.vm`, etc.).

Over recent Java versions (especially from Java 9 onward), the module system and encapsulation have made using these internal APIs from user code more restricted (and often discouraged).

Below is a breakdown:

---

## üì¶ What is `jdk.internal` (and related internal APIs)

* The `jdk.*` namespace includes packages that are part of the the **JDK implementation**, but not part of the **Java SE standard API**.
* `jdk.internal.*` packages are specifically internal support/utilities not intended to be used by external applications.
* With **JEP 403: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals**, most internal APIs (including many `jdk.internal` classes) are strongly encapsulated by default in JDK 17 and beyond. Access via reflection or direct calling is restricted unless explicitly opened via `--add-opens` or similar. ([InfoQ][1])
* Using internal APIs is fragile: they may change or be removed without notice in future Java versions.

## üîç Important `jdk.internal` packages & classes (examples) + brief explanation

Below are some representative `jdk.internal` packages / classes with a sketch of their purpose. This is **not an exhaustive list**, but covers major ones you might encounter or see in JDK code.

| Package / Class                                   | Purpose / Role                                                                                                                              | Notes & Use Cases                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jdk.internal.util.Preconditions`                 | Utility class to check method preconditions (like null checks, argument ranges)                                                             | Similar in purpose to Guava‚Äôs `Preconditions`. Example: `checkNotNull(...)`. ([GitHub][2])                                             |
| `jdk.internal.vm.annotation.*`                    | Annotations used internally by the JVM or JIT compiler                                                                                      | For example, annotations like `IntrinsicCandidate` to mark methods for intrinsic replacement etc.                                      |
| `jdk.internal.jvmci.runtime`                      | JDK-internal interface between the JVM and the Graal JIT / JVMCI (JVM Compiler Interface)                                                   | Used when JDK is built with Graal compiler support. ([lafo.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at][3])                                                     |
| Other internal support / hotspot bridging classes | E.g. internal bridge between Java APIs and native VM, runtime helpers, internal implementations of reflection, Unsafe-related classes, etc. | Many classes that manage low-level behavior, memory, threading, class loading, etc., may live under `jdk.internal` or `sun.*` packages |

## üõ° Encapsulation & Restrictions

* Starting Java 9, the **module system** allows the JDK to **export only public APIs** and hide internal ones.
* Internal APIs (including many in `jdk.internal`) are not exported by default. Application modules cannot depend on them.
* In JDK 17 with strong encapsulation (JEP 403), even reflective access to internal APIs is blocked unless explicitly opened. ([InfoQ][1])
* Developers are encouraged to use **public, supported APIs** instead of `jdk.internal` classes.
