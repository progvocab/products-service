Excellent question ðŸ‘Œ â€” this is a very common misunderstanding about the **`WITH` clause (Common Table Expression, CTE)** in Oracle SQL.

---

## 1. What the `WITH` Clause Really Does

* The `WITH` clause is just **syntactic sugar** for an inline view (subquery in the `FROM` clause).
* By default, Oracle **inlines** the CTE: it substitutes the CTE definition back into the main query before optimization.
* That means:

  ```sql
  WITH cte AS (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 10)
  SELECT * FROM cte;
  ```

  is treated the same as:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 10);
  ```

ðŸ‘‰ **No performance benefit, no cost reduction** just because you used `WITH`.

---

## 2. Why Cost Doesnâ€™t Change

* Oracleâ€™s **optimizer sees the same query** whether you use `WITH` or not.
* Since `WITH` is inlined by default, the **execution plan and cost remain identical**.
* Cost is reduced only when you actually change the execution path (e.g., fewer scans, more efficient joins), not by rearranging syntax.

---

## 3. When `WITH` *Can* Change Performance

* If you use the **`MATERIALIZE` hint**:

  ```sql
  WITH cte AS (
       SELECT /*+ MATERIALIZE */ * 
       FROM employees WHERE dept_id < 50
  )
  SELECT * FROM cte WHERE salary > 5000;
  ```

  Oracle forces the CTE to be evaluated once, stored temporarily, and reused.

  * This can reduce cost if the CTE is expensive and referenced multiple times.
  * But it can also **increase cost** if materialization writes to TEMP unnecessarily.

* If you use the **`INLINE` hint**:

  ```sql
  WITH cte AS (
       SELECT /*+ INLINE */ * 
       FROM employees WHERE dept_id < 50
  )
  SELECT * FROM cte WHERE salary > 5000;
  ```

  You explicitly tell Oracle to inline it (default behavior).

---

## 4. Key Takeaway

* `WITH` by itself does **not reduce query cost** â€” itâ€™s purely for readability and structure.
* To actually affect cost:

  * Reuse the `WITH` query multiple times **with MATERIALIZE**
  * Optimize joins, indexes, or predicates
  * Reduce redundant scans

---

âœ… **Final Answer:**
Using a `WITH` clause does not reduce cost in Oracle because it is usually **inlined** into the main query. Only when you force **materialization** (with hints) or restructure the query logic in a way that reduces redundant work will you see a different cost.

---

Do you want me to show you a **side-by-side execution plan** (`DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR`) of a `WITH` clause with and without `MATERIALIZE` to illustrate how cost can change?
