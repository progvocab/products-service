Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive list of behavioral design patterns**, including the **original Gang of Four (GoF)** patterns and **modern or extended behavioral patterns** that are widely used in **enterprise systems, Spring Framework, distributed systems, and functional programming**.

---

## **A. Gang of Four (GoF) Behavioral Design Patterns (11 Total)**

| Pattern        | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Passes request along a chain of handlers. |
| **Command**    | Encapsulates a request as an object. |
| **Interpreter**| Defines a grammar and interprets sentences in the grammar. |
| **Iterator**   | Provides a way to access elements sequentially. |
| **Mediator**   | Centralizes complex communications between objects. |
| **Memento**    | Captures and restores an object’s internal state. |
| **Observer**   | Defines a one-to-many dependency (event listeners). |
| **State**      | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes. |
| **Strategy**   | Defines a family of algorithms and selects one at runtime. |
| **Template Method** | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method. |
| **Visitor**    | Separates operations from the objects on which they operate. |

## **B. Modern / Extended Behavioral Patterns**

These patterns extend or adapt GoF ideas in the context of modern architecture, especially **Spring Boot**, **microservices**, **functional programming**, and **reactive systems**.

| Pattern                     | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| **Event Sourcing**          | Captures all changes as a sequence of events. |
| **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** | Separates read and write operations. |
| **Specification Pattern**   | Encapsulates query logic in composable specifications. |
| **Null Object Pattern**     | Avoids null checks by using default behavior objects. |
| **Callback Pattern**        | Passes logic as parameter (common in JavaScript, also Java 8+). |
| **Reactive Streams / Observer Hybrid** | Foundation of reactive programming (Flux, Mono). |
| **Policy Pattern**          | Runtime configuration of object behavior (often used with Strategy). |
| **Pipeline / Chain**        | Composition of behaviors in sequence (used in web filters, streams). |
| **Command Bus / Dispatcher**| A mediator that routes commands to appropriate handlers. |
| **Saga Pattern** (Microservices) | Manages distributed transactions with compensation logic. |

## **C. Behavioral Patterns in Spring Boot / Framework**

| Pattern                    | Use Case / Example |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Strategy**               | `AuthenticationProvider`, `PasswordEncoder` |
| **Template Method**        | `JdbcTemplate`, `RestTemplate`, `AbstractController` |
| **Observer**               | `ApplicationListener`, `@EventListener` |
| **Command**                | `Runnable`, `Callable`, controller commands |
| **State**                  | State machines (Spring State Machine) |
| **Chain of Responsibility**| Servlet Filters, HandlerInterceptorChain |
| **Mediator**               | `ApplicationEventPublisher` as central dispatcher |
| **Null Object**            | Returning safe fallbacks instead of null |
| **Specification**          | `JpaSpecificationExecutor` in Spring Data |
| **Visitor**                | Visitor-like behavior in JSON/XML parser libraries |
| **Pipeline**               | Spring WebFlux filter chain, Stream APIs |

## **D. Classification Summary**

| Classification       | Examples                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation of behavior** | Strategy, Command, Template Method |
| **Communication between objects** | Observer, Mediator, Chain of Responsibility |
| **Control flow / execution logic** | State, Iterator, Visitor, Memento |
| **Adapted for modern architectures** | CQRS, Saga, Event Sourcing, Reactive Streams |
