Good question üëç Let‚Äôs break it down in the context of **Oracle SQL**.

---

### 1. **`COALESCE`**

* Syntax: `COALESCE(expr1, expr2, ..., exprN)`
* Returns the **first non-null expression** from the list.
* Equivalent to a `CASE` expression like:

```sql
CASE 
   WHEN expr1 IS NOT NULL THEN expr1
   WHEN expr2 IS NOT NULL THEN expr2
   ...
   ELSE exprN
END
```

* Oracle rewrites `COALESCE` internally into a `CASE` expression.
* Short-circuits evaluation: stops as soon as it finds a non-null.

---

### 2. **`CASE`**

* More general-purpose: allows any conditional logic (not only null checks).
* Example:

```sql
CASE
   WHEN col1 IS NOT NULL THEN col1
   WHEN col2 IS NOT NULL THEN col2
   ELSE col3
END
```

* Can handle expressions not related to null-checking, e.g. comparisons, ranges, complex conditions.

---

### 3. **Performance Comparison**

* **Oracle optimizer translates `COALESCE` to `CASE` internally**, so in most cases **performance is identical**.
* Both are evaluated lazily (short-circuit), so if the first non-null is found early, later expressions are not evaluated.
* If expressions are simple (column references, literals), **no measurable difference**.
* If expressions involve function calls or subqueries, performance depends more on those than on whether you use `COALESCE` or `CASE`.

---

### 4. **When to Use What**

* **Use `COALESCE`** ‚Üí when your only goal is to return the first non-null value. It‚Äôs shorter, more readable, and self-documenting.
* **Use `CASE`** ‚Üí when you need more complex branching logic (not just null handling).

---

‚úÖ **Final Answer:**
In Oracle SQL, **`COALESCE` and `CASE` have the same performance** because Oracle rewrites `COALESCE` as a `CASE` internally. Choose `COALESCE` for readability when handling nulls; choose `CASE` when you need more complex conditions.

Do you want me to show you an **execution plan comparison** for `COALESCE` vs `CASE` with a sample query in Oracle so you can see the optimizer‚Äôs rewrite?
