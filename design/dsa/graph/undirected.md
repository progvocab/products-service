Yes 👍 — there **are graph algorithms that are meaningful only for undirected graphs**, and either do not apply or require very different treatment in directed graphs. Let me walk you through the main ones:

# 🔹 Graph Algorithms Specific to **Undirected Graphs**

### 1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms**

* **Examples**: Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Borůvka’s algorithms.
* **Why undirected only?**

  * MST is defined only for **undirected graphs** — because the concept of a "spanning tree" (a tree covering all vertices) relies on the idea that edges are bidirectional.
  * In directed graphs, the analogue is called a **Directed Spanning Tree / Arborescence**, and a completely different algorithm (Edmonds’ algorithm) is required.
* **Applications**: Network design, clustering, approximation algorithms.

---

### 2. **Bridge-finding algorithms**

* **Bridge (cut-edge):** An edge in an undirected graph whose removal increases the number of connected components.
* **Tarjan’s algorithm** finds bridges in $O(V+E)$.
* In directed graphs, the analogous concept is more complex (**strongly connected components** and **cut-edges in directed graphs**), so the same bridge algorithm does not apply directly.

---

### 3. **Articulation points (cut vertices)**

* A vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.
* Defined naturally in **undirected graphs**.
* In directed graphs, the related concept is **strong articulation points**, but that requires different algorithms and definitions.

---

### 4. **Connected components**

* In undirected graphs → **Connected components** (straightforward BFS/DFS).
* In directed graphs → must use **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)** (Kosaraju, Tarjan, or Gabow algorithms).
* The undirected version is simpler; SCC algorithms are entirely different.

---

### 5. **Eulerian Path/Circuit (in undirected graphs)**

* Existence condition (undirected):

  * Eulerian circuit: all vertices have **even degree**.
  * Eulerian path: exactly **0 or 2 vertices have odd degree**.
* For directed graphs → the condition is very different (in-degree = out-degree for circuits).
* Algorithms like Fleury’s and Hierholzer’s are typically first defined for **undirected graphs**, then adapted separately for directed graphs.

---

### 6. **Tree-specific algorithms** (since trees are undirected by definition)

* Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithms.
* Diameter of a tree (using BFS/DFS).
* Tree isomorphism checks.
* Directed analogs (arborescences) exist but behave differently.

# 🔹 Summary Table

| Algorithm / Concept         | Undirected Graphs        | Directed Graphs Equivalent                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) | ✅ Yes (Kruskal, Prim)    | 🚫 Not defined (use Edmonds’ arborescence) |
| Bridges (cut edges)         | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ Needs different definition               |
| Articulation points         | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ Strong articulation points, more complex |
| Connected components        | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ Use SCC algorithms                       |
| Eulerian path/circuit       | ✅ Yes (degree condition) | ✅ Different in/out degree condition        |
| Tree algorithms             | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ Different for directed trees             |

✅ So yes — **MST, bridges, articulation points, and connected components** are examples of algorithms that are fundamentally **for undirected graphs only**, unless redefined for directed cases.

👉 Do you want me to prepare a **visual diagram** comparing which graph algorithms are:

* Only for **undirected**
* Only for **directed**
* Work for **both**?
