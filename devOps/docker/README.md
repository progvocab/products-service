## üéØ TL;DR: Docker = Images + Containers + Tools

* **Dockerfile** ‚ûù defines how an image is built
* **Image** ‚ûù blueprint or template for containers
* **Container** ‚ûù running instance of an image
* **Compose** ‚ûù manages multiple containers
* **ECR/Registry** ‚ûù stores and distributes images
* **Layers** ‚ûù every image is a set of cached layers
* **Volumes/Networks** ‚ûù add persistence and communication
