Are you asking about setting up an **Airflow listener** to monitor and react to Airflow events, such as DAG runs, task executions, or failures? If so, there are a few approaches:

### **1. Using Airflow Event Listeners (Callback Functions)**
- Airflow allows defining callbacks like `on_success_callback`, `on_failure_callback`, and `on_retry_callback` in DAGs.
- Example:
  ```python
  from airflow.models import DAG
  from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
  from datetime import datetime

  def task_success_callback(context):
      print(f"Task {context['task_instance'].task_id} succeeded.")

  with DAG(
      'example_listener_dag',
      start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval=None,
  ) as dag:
      
      task = PythonOperator(
          task_id="my_task",
          python_callable=lambda: print("Task executed"),
          on_success_callback=task_success_callback
      )
  ```

### **2. Listening for Airflow Events with Log Monitoring**
- You can create a script to **monitor Airflow logs** for task execution details.
- This can be integrated with external logging systems like ELK, Splunk, or AWS CloudWatch.

### **3. Using Airflow REST API for Event Polling**
- Airflow has a REST API (`/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns`) to check DAG execution status.
- Example API request:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://your-airflow-url/api/v1/dags/my_dag/dagRuns" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  ```

### **4. Using Apache Airflow Webhooks & Message Queues**
- Airflow does not natively support webhooks, but you can push events to Kafka, Redis, or an external API from `on_success_callback` or `on_failure_callback`.

### **5. Using Airflow's Event-Driven Framework (Deferrable Operators)**
- With **deferrable operators**, tasks can pause and resume based on external events.

Do you need a real-time event listener outside Airflow, or are you looking to implement this inside your DAGs?
