Programming paradigms are different **styles or approaches** to writing code. Each paradigm offers a unique model for **organizing, thinking about, and solving problems in software**.

## ðŸ§­ Major Programming Paradigms

Here are the most commonly used paradigms:

| Paradigm                  | Core Idea                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Imperative**            | Write explicit step-by-step instructions                                |
| **Procedural**            | Break down code into reusable procedures/functions                      |
| **Object-Oriented (OOP)** | Model code around real-world "objects" with data and behavior           |
| **Functional**            | Use pure functions, immutability, and expressions                       |
| **Declarative**           | Describe *what* the program should do, not *how* to do it               |
| **Logic Programming**     | Declare facts and rules; the engine deduces answers                     |
| **Event-Driven**          | Execution flow is controlled by events or messages                      |
| **Reactive Programming**  | Work with asynchronous data streams and automatic propagation           |
| **Aspect-Oriented (AOP)** | Separate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) using aspects |
| **Symbolic/Rule-Based**   | Solve problems via transformation rules (used in AI, e.g., Prolog)      |
| **Dataflow Programming**  | Define the flow of data between operations or nodes                     |
| **Concurrent/Parallel**   | Design systems to run multiple processes simultaneously                 |

## ðŸ“¦ Categorized View

### 1. **Imperative Paradigms**

These involve giving the computer commands on **how** to do things.

* **Procedural** (C, Pascal)
* **Object-Oriented** (Java, Python, C++)
* **Aspect-Oriented** (AspectJ, Spring AOP)

### 2. **Declarative Paradigms**

You declare **what** result you want, not how to compute it.

* **Functional** (Haskell, Elixir, Scala, F#)
* **Logic** (Prolog)
* **SQL** (Declarative querying)

### 3. **Concurrent / Parallel Paradigms**

Dealing with multiple processes or threads:

* **Actor Model** (Akka, Erlang)
* **Fork-Join / Thread-Based** (Java, C++ with threads)

### 4. **Reactive / Event-Based**

React to data/events over time:

* **ReactiveX**, **RxJava**, **Reactor**
* **GUI frameworks** (e.g., JavaScript in browsers)

| Declarative  | SQL queries, infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform) |
| Reactive     | Real-time apps, stock tickers, dashboards             |
| Event-Driven | GUI apps, microservices with messaging                |
| Logic        | Rule engines, AI inference                            |
