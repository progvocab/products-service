* A **filter (kernel)** is a small learnable matrix that slides over the input and detects **one specific pattern**, producing **one feature map**.
* A **layer** is a collection of many filters applied together, producing **multiple feature maps** at once.
* **In short:** *one filter → one feature map; many filters → one convolutional layer*.
