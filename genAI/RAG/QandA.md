Creating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for question answering on a PDF document involves combining **retrieval-based methods** (to find relevant information) with **generative models** (to generate answers). Here's the simplest way to implement this using Python and popular libraries like **LangChain**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **FAISS** for vector search.

---

### **Steps to Create a RAG System for PDF Question Answering**

#### 1. **Install Required Libraries**
Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install langchain transformers faiss-cpu PyPDF2 sentence-transformers
```

- **LangChain**: Framework for building RAG pipelines.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for pre-trained models.
- **FAISS**: Efficient vector search library.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDFs.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For embedding text into vectors.

---

#### 2. **Extract Text from the PDF**
Use `PyPDF2` to extract text from the PDF file.

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    reader = PdfReader(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()
    return text

pdf_path = "your_document.pdf"
text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
print(text[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters to verify
```

---

#### 3. **Chunk the Text**
Split the text into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=500,  # Number of characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=50  # Overlap between chunks
)

chunks = text_splitter.split_text(text)
print(f"Number of chunks: {len(chunks)}")
```

---

#### 4. **Embed the Text Chunks**
Use a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers`) to convert text chunks into vectors.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedding_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  # Lightweight embedding model
chunk_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(chunks)
```

---

#### 5. **Build a Vector Store**
Use **FAISS** to create a vector store for efficient similarity search.

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Create a FAISS index
dimension = chunk_embeddings.shape[1]  # Dimension of embeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)  # L2 distance for similarity search
index.add(np.array(chunk_embeddings))  # Add embeddings to the index
```

---

#### 6. **Retrieve Relevant Chunks**
Given a user question, retrieve the most relevant chunks from the vector store.

```python
def retrieve_relevant_chunks(question, top_k=3):
    question_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])
    distances, indices = index.search(question_embedding, top_k)
    relevant_chunks = [chunks[i] for i in indices[0]]
    return relevant_chunks

question = "What is the main topic of the document?"
relevant_chunks = retrieve_relevant_chunks(question)
print("Relevant chunks:", relevant_chunks)
```

---

#### 7. **Generate Answers Using a Language Model**
Use a pre-trained generative model (e.g., Hugging Face's `flan-t5` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`) to generate answers based on the retrieved chunks.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained question-answering model
qa_pipeline = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="google/flan-t5-small")

def generate_answer(question, relevant_chunks):
    context = " ".join(relevant_chunks)
    input_text = f"question: {question} context: {context}"
    answer = qa_pipeline(input_text, max_length=200)[0]['generated_text']
    return answer

answer = generate_answer(question, relevant_chunks)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

---

#### 8. **Put It All Together**
Combine the steps into a single function for easy use.

```python
def rag_qa_system(pdf_path, question):
    # Step 1: Extract text
    text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
    
    # Step 2: Chunk text
    chunks = text_splitter.split_text(text)
    
    # Step 3: Embed chunks
    chunk_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(chunks)
    
    # Step 4: Build FAISS index
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(chunk_embeddings.shape[1])
    index.add(np.array(chunk_embeddings))
    
    # Step 5: Retrieve relevant chunks
    relevant_chunks = retrieve_relevant_chunks(question)
    
    # Step 6: Generate answer
    answer = generate_answer(question, relevant_chunks)
    
    return answer

# Example usage
pdf_path = "your_document.pdf"
question = "What is the main topic of the document?"
answer = rag_qa_system(pdf_path, question)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

### **Key Improvements**
1. **Use Better Embeddings**: Replace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` with larger models like `all-mpnet-base-v2` for better accuracy.
2. **Use a Larger Language Model**: Replace `flan-t5-small` with `flan-t5-large` or OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` for better answer generation.
3. **Add Metadata**: Store metadata (e.g., page numbers) with chunks for better context.
4. **Fine-Tune Models**: Fine-tune the embedding or generative model on domain-specific data for improved performance.

---

### **Example Output**
For a PDF about machine learning, the system might answer:

**Question**: What is supervised learning?  
**Answer**: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

This is a simple yet effective RAG pipeline for question answering on PDFs. You can extend it further based on your needs!
