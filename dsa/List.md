### How to Practice
1. **Solve Problems Incrementally**: Start with easier problems, then gradually move to harder ones.
2. **Use Platforms**: Practice on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
3. **Understand Concepts**: Focus on understanding the underlying data structure or algorithm instead of memorizing solutions.

By solving these questions, you’ll cover a wide range of DSA concepts, preparing you thoroughly for interviews.
