Excellent question ‚Äî this is **one of the most common performance pain points** in Oracle (and any RDBMS):
üëâ **Why `INSERT INTO` becomes slow when inserting a large number of records.**

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly and deeply üëá

## üß© Root Cause ‚Äî Why Bulk Inserts Are Slow

When you insert many rows (e.g. millions) with plain `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)`, Oracle does a **lot more than just writing rows**.
It performs *ACID* operations for **every row or every small batch**, and each layer of Oracle‚Äôs architecture adds overhead.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Reasons (Detailed)

| #   | Area                                       | What Happens                                                                                | Impact                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Redo Logging**                           | Oracle logs every insert to the **redo log** to ensure recoverability (for crash recovery). | Heavy I/O on redo logs, especially if each insert is its own transaction. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Undo / Rollback Segment**                | Oracle also writes undo data so that the insert can be rolled back if needed.               | Additional I/O + undo tablespace growth.                                  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Per-row Commit Overhead**                | If you commit after each insert (or small batch), Oracle must flush redo logs each time.    | Drastic slowdown (up to 100x slower).                                     |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Index Maintenance**                      | For every insert, all indexes on the table are updated.                                     | Each index update causes random I/O + CPU cost.                           |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Triggers & Constraints**                 | `BEFORE/AFTER INSERT` triggers, foreign key checks, and constraints fire for each row.      | Each adds a procedural execution step per row.                            |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Row-by-Row (‚ÄúSlow-by-Slow‚Äù) Processing** | Inserting via loops or individual `INSERT` statements in PL/SQL.                            | Context switching between SQL and PL/SQL engine.                          |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **Network Round Trips**                    | If inserts come from an application sending one row per statement.                          | Each insert = one network round trip.                                     |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | **Buffer Cache Pressure**                  | Large inserts may flush Oracle buffer cache frequently.                                     | Causes cache churn and more physical I/O.                                 |

## üöÄ How to Make It Fast

| Technique                                              | Description                                                                         | Performance Gain                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| üß∫ **Use Bulk Inserts (FORALL)**                       | In PL/SQL, use `FORALL` instead of looping over inserts.                            | 10x‚Äì100x faster (reduces context switches).           |
| üì¶ **Use `INSERT /*+ APPEND */` (Direct Path Insert)** | Bypasses buffer cache and writes directly to datafiles in append mode.              | 2x‚Äì5x faster (no undo, minimal redo).                 |
| üß© **Use `SQL*Loader` or `External Tables`**           | Oracle‚Äôs utilities for large data loads.                                            | Best for millions of rows ‚Äî uses direct path loading. |
| üßÆ **Disable Indexes & Constraints Temporarily**       | Drop or disable secondary indexes and foreign keys before load, then rebuild after. | Huge performance boost when safe.                     |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Batch Commits**                                   | Commit every N rows (e.g. 10,000) instead of each row.                              | Reduces redo log writes dramatically.                 |
| üî• **Use Parallel DML**                                | `ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;` + `INSERT /*+ PARALLEL */`                     | Parallelizes data loading.                            |
| üß∞ **Use CTAS (Create Table As Select)**               | If inserting from another table: `CREATE TABLE new AS SELECT ...`                   | Very fast ‚Äî direct path by default.                   |
| üßπ **Adjust Redo Logging (nologging)**                 | For non-critical bulk loads: `ALTER TABLE table_name NOLOGGING;`                    | Reduces redo log overhead. (Be cautious!)             |

## üß† Extra Deep: Oracle‚Äôs Internal Paths

| Insert Mode   | Path Used             | Writes to                           | Redo/Undo                   | When Used                                |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Normal Insert | **Conventional Path** | Buffer cache ‚Üí Datafiles            | Full redo & undo            | Default                                  |
| Direct Insert | **Direct Path**       | Datafiles directly (bypasses cache) | Minimal redo (if NOLOGGING) | `INSERT /*+ APPEND */`, CTAS, SQL*Loader |

## üß© Diagnostic Tip

You can check what‚Äôs slowing you down using:

```sql
SELECT event, total_waits, time_waited/100 time_waited_s
FROM v$session_event
WHERE sid = <your_session_id>;
```

Look for:

* `log file sync` ‚Üí too frequent commits
* `db file sequential read` ‚Üí index I/O
* `buffer busy waits` ‚Üí cache contention

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

| Root Cause                  | Fix                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Too many commits            | Commit in batches                           |
| Row-by-row inserts          | Use bulk insert (`FORALL`, `INSERT SELECT`) |
| Index & constraint overhead | Disable temporarily                         |
| Redo logging                | Use `NOLOGGING` or direct path              |
| Buffer cache pressure       | Use `INSERT /*+ APPEND */`                  |
| Network round trips         | Use array/bulk binds from app               |

Would you like me to show an example of a **PL/SQL script** that performs a **fast bulk insert using `FORALL` and `INSERT /*+ APPEND */`**, with timing comparison against normal inserts?
