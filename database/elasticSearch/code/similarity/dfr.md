**DFR (Divergence From Randomness)** is a probabilistic similarity model used in **information retrieval**, particularly in search engines like **Apache Lucene** and **Elasticsearch**. It is based on the idea that **the more a term diverges from what would be expected by chance (randomness), the more relevant it is**.

---

### **Concept Overview**

DFR assumes that documents are generated by a random process. When a term occurs in a document **more often than expected**, it is likely to be important or relevant.

The **basic formula** follows:

```
Score = Normalization * InformationContent * AfterEffect
```

Where:
- **Normalization** accounts for document length.
- **Information Content** measures divergence from randomness.
- **After Effect** considers the gain of information from seeing the term again.

### **Components of DFR**

DFR combines three customizable models:

1. **Basic Model (information content)**:
   - Examples: `I(F)`, `P`, `PL`, `DP`, `GL2`
   - These estimate how much information a term provides.

2. **AfterEffect**:
   - Examples: `B` (Binomial), `L` (Laplace)
   - Measures additional gain from a term occurring again in a document.

3. **Normalization**:
   - Examples: `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `Z`
   - Normalizes for document length or term frequency.

### **Example in Elasticsearch**

In Elasticsearch, you can use DFR with custom ranking via the `similarity` settings:

```json
"similarity": {
  "my_dfr": {
    "type": "DFR",
    "basic_model": "g",        
    "after_effect": "l",       
    "normalization": "h2",     
    "normalization.h2.c": "3.0"
  }
}
```

Then apply it to fields in your mapping:

```json
"mappings": {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "similarity": "my_dfr"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Use Cases**

- Full-text search with **statistical relevance scoring**.
- Advanced ranking in search engines like Lucene/Elasticsearch.
- Scenarios where **BM25** does not perform well due to term frequency distribution.

### **Comparison to BM25**

| Feature              | BM25                            | DFR                                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Model Type           | Heuristic / Probabilistic       | Probabilistic / Statistical            |
| Focus                | Term frequency + document length| Divergence from randomness             |
| Customization        | Limited                         | Highly modular (basic model, effect, norm) |
| When Better?         | General-purpose search          | Advanced tuning, better rare-term modeling |
