Yes — below is a **real-world style case study + system design** that shows how an organization can (and many do) combine **Kubernetes, Istio, Keycloak, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ** into a reliable, secure microservices platform.
I built this case study from public patterns, vendor/blog docs and real engineering write-ups about using these pieces together (citations inline).

# 1) Short description (real-world scenario)

**Context:** A global fintech / payments platform that provides user accounts, transaction history, fraud detection, notifications and partner integrations.
**Goals:** multi-region availability, strong zero-trust security, low-latency APIs, event-driven processing, and both relational and document storage for different workloads.

Key public references that show these components are commonly used together:

* Patterns for securing services with **Istio + Keycloak** and request-level auth. ([InfraCloud][1])
* Running **PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ** on Kubernetes as platform services. ([elastisys][2])
* Deploying and exposing **MongoDB** in Kubernetes and integrating with Istio. ([Istio][3])
* Practical Keycloak + Postgres on k8s examples and Helm charts. ([GitHub][4])

# 3) Component roles & why chosen

* **Kubernetes** — container orchestration, autoscaling, namespace isolation, rolling upgrades. (standard for cloud-native stacks)
* **Istio (service mesh)** — mTLS between services, request-level routing, telemetry (traces/metrics), central policy enforcement for a zero-trust posture. Useful for enforcing Keycloak-issued tokens at the mesh edge or via Envoy filters. ([Keycloak][5])
* **Keycloak** — identity provider (OIDC/OAuth2). Issues access and refresh tokens; integrates with Istio for service-to-service authentication and with apps for user SSO. Use PostgreSQL as Keycloak persistence. ([GitHub][4])
* **PostgreSQL** — canonical relational store for transactional data (accounts, balances, ledgers). Run as a managed DB or highly-available k8s StatefulSet/Operator. Guides exist for running Postgres as a platform service in k8s. ([elastisys][2])
* **MongoDB** — flexible document store for schema-flexible data: activity logs, session dumps, event enrichment, and user metadata. MongoDB on Kubernetes and exposing to Istio are documented patterns. ([Istio][3])
* **RabbitMQ** — message broker for event-driven flows (payments pipeline, async notifications, retries). Proven to run inside k8s and to integrate with Postgres/Mongo backed consumers. ([elastisys][2])
* **S3 / CDN** — object store for media/backups/large blobs (receipts, statements).

---

# 4) Example data & message flows

**A. API request with auth**

1. Client obtains access token from Keycloak (OIDC).
2. Client calls API via Istio Gateway; Istio validates JWT against Keycloak (or the API service validates it). Istio enforces mTLS + RBAC for inter-service calls. ([InfraCloud][1])
3. Backend API verifies token claims and handles request (reads/writes Postgres for account ops; writes event to RabbitMQ).

**B. Event-driven payment processing**

1. API writes transaction record in **Postgres** (ACID).
2. API pushes a "transaction.created" event to **RabbitMQ** (durable queue).
3. Worker services (scaling consumers) pick up the event, call external payment gateways, update transaction status in Postgres, and append enriched logs to **MongoDB** for analytics & replay.

**C. Notifications**

1. Once worker completes, it publishes "transaction.completed" events; a Notification consumer formats messages and pushes mobile push via a gateway and writes audit doc to MongoDB/S3.

---

# 5) Security design (Istio + Keycloak + Pods)

* **Edge Authentication:** Istio Gateway accepts only mTLS connections and requires valid JWTs issued by Keycloak for public APIs. Use Keycloak’s JWKS for token verification. (See CNCF/InfraCloud patterns.) ([InfraCloud][1])
* **Service-to-service:** Istio auto-injects Envoy sidecars; enable mTLS for in-mesh encryption. Use Istio AuthorizationPolicies to restrict which services can call which APIs. ([Keycloak][5])
* **Secrets:** Kubernetes Secrets stored via a secrets manager (Vault / KMS), mounted into pods or injected by CSI.
* **RBAC:** Use Keycloak roles mapped to Kubernetes namespaces/service accounts when needed.

---

# 6) High availability, scaling & operational concerns

* **Databases:** Use Operators (Crunchy/Postgres Operator, MongoDB Operator) for HA, backups, failover. Percona/official guides show exposing DBs with Istio considerations. ([Percona][6])
* **RabbitMQ:** Run as a clustered StatefulSet with persistent volumes; use durable queues and mirrored queues across AZs. Elastisys writeups discuss running RabbitMQ/Postgres on k8s as platform services. ([elastisys][2])
* **Keycloak:** Run as stateless pods with Postgres; run multiple replicas + sticky sessions for admin console; use Helm charts or Operator for production. ([GitHub][4])
* **Observability:** Istio telemetry + Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger for tracing. Centralized logging (ELK/EFK) and alerting.
* **CI/CD:** GitOps (ArgoCD) for manifests/Helm; pipelines for image builds and canary rollouts (Istio traffic splitting).

---

# 7) Typical pitfalls & mitigations (practical lessons)

* **Sidecar traffic to DBs:** Some databases don’t expect sidecar interception — ensure proper egress config in Istio or use egress gateways for DB traffic. Percona and Istio docs cover exposing databases safely. ([Percona][6])
* **Token validation latency:** Cache JWKS and use local validation to avoid Keycloak being a single point for auth checks. Use short-lived tokens + refresh.
* **Operator maturity:** Use battle-tested Operators (MongoDB/Crunchy/Postgres) — avoid DIY for stateful services at scale. ([operatorhub.io][7])
* **Message ordering & idempotency:** Design idempotent consumers and use deduplication keys in events.

---

# 8) Short concrete deployment blueprint (what to install first)

1. Kubernetes cluster (multi-AZ), network & storage classes.
2. Install Istio (control plane + ingress/gateway) and enable mTLS. ([itnext.io][8])
3. Install Postgres Operator + provision DB for application & Keycloak. ([Crunchy Data][9])
4. Deploy Keycloak (Helm) backed by Postgres. ([GitHub][4])
5. Deploy RabbitMQ cluster (StatefulSet / Operator). ([elastisys][2])
6. Deploy MongoDB (Operator / Atlas) and expose to cluster with Istio egress rules. ([Istio][3])
7. Deploy microservices (stateless) with sidecar injection, configure Istio AuthorizationPolicy to require Keycloak JWTs. ([InfraCloud][1])

If you want, I can now:

* produce a **detailed sequence diagram** for the auth + payment flows; or
* give you a **Helm/manifest starter kit** (Keycloak+Postgres + RabbitMQ + sample API) for deployment on a test cluster; or
* show an **Istio AuthorizationPolicy + Envoy JWT filter** example that validates Keycloak tokens before reaching services.
