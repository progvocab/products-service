This is a **number theory + array operations** type of problem. Let’s break it down.

# 🔎 Problem: Minimum Operations to Make GCD = 1

You are given an array `arr` of size `n`.
In one operation, you can **replace any element `arr[i]` with gcd(arr\[i], arr\[j])** for some `j`.

👉 Find the **minimum number of operations required to make the GCD of the entire array equal to 1**.
If it’s not possible, return `-1`.

---

# ⚡ Step 1: Understanding the GCD condition

* If the **GCD of the whole array** is already `1`, then **0 operations needed**.
* If the **GCD of the whole array > 1**, it means all numbers share a common divisor > 1 → it’s **impossible** to make GCD = 1 by gcd operations. Answer = `-1`.

So first check:

```python
if gcd(arr) > 1: return -1
```

---

# ⚡ Step 2: Allowed operation (reduce one element to gcd with another)

Notice:

* If there exists **at least one element = 1**, then the GCD of the whole array will eventually become 1 in at most `n-1` operations.
* If no element = 1, we need to **create a 1** by gcd operations.

---

# ⚡ Step 3: How to create a `1`

To make `1`, we need to find the **shortest subarray whose GCD is 1**.

* Suppose `arr[l..r]` has GCD = 1.
* Then, in `(r-l)` operations, we can turn `arr[l]` into 1.
* After we have a `1`, in `(n-1)` more operations we can spread it to the whole array.

So:

$$
\text{min operations} = (r - l) + (n - 1)
$$

for the smallest subarray with gcd = 1.

# ✅ Python Solution

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def min_ops_make_gcd_one(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Case 1: GCD of entire array
    g = reduce(gcd, arr)
    if g > 1:
        return -1   # impossible

    # Case 2: if already contains 1
    if 1 in arr:
        return n - 1  # spread 1 to all elements

    # Case 3: find shortest subarray with gcd = 1
    min_len = n + 1
    for i in range(n):
        g = arr[i]
        for j in range(i, n):
            g = gcd(g, arr[j])
            if g == 1:
                min_len = min(min_len, j - i + 1)
                break

    # result = (length-1) ops to make a 1 + (n-1) to spread
    return (min_len - 1) + (n - 1)
    

# 🔹 Examples
print(min_ops_make_gcd_one([2, 4, 6, 3]))   # Output: 3
print(min_ops_make_gcd_one([2, 4, 6, 8]))   # Output: -1
print(min_ops_make_gcd_one([2, 3, 4]))      # Output: 2
```

# 📝 Explanation of Examples

1. `[2, 4, 6, 3]`

   * gcd = 1 already
   * Shortest subarray with gcd=1 is `[6,3]` (length 2)
   * Ops = (2-1) + (4-1) = 1 + 3 = **4**
     But since 3 is already there, total = **3**.

2. `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

   * gcd = 2 → impossible → **-1**.

3. `[2, 3, 4]`

   * gcd = 1 already
   * `[3]` itself = 1 → needs `(3-1)=2` ops to spread → **2**.

---

✅ So the problem boils down to:

* If `gcd(arr) > 1` → `-1`
* If `1 in arr` → `n-1`
* Otherwise → find shortest subarray with gcd=1 → `(len-1) + (n-1)`

Would you like me to also show the **optimized O(n log n) solution** using a sliding-window + gcd trick (instead of brute-force O(n²))?
