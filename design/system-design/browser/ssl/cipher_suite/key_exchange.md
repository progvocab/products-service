Perfect — let’s go deeper and walk through a **technical, real-data example** of how a modern cipher suite (say,
👉 **`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`**) actually works in a **TLS 1.2 handshake**, including the *real cryptographic numbers* exchanged and how each of the four operations occurs internally.

---

## 🔧 Scenario

Let’s assume:

* **Client:** Alice (her browser)
* **Server:** Bob (a web server, e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com))
* **Cipher Suite:** `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
* **TLS version:** 1.2 (conceptually similar for TLS 1.3, though it merges steps)

We’ll trace this from the handshake → key generation → encryption → message authentication.

---

# 🧩 Step 1: Key Exchange — *ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Ephemeral)*

This is where both sides agree on a **shared secret** used for encryption later.

### 1️⃣ Curve and Parameters

They agree on an elliptic curve, e.g. **secp256r1** (NIST P-256):

[
y^2 = x^3 - 3x + b \pmod p
]

where
( p = 2^{256} - 2^{224} + 2^{192} + 2^{96} - 1 )

---

### 2️⃣ Private/Public Keys

Each side generates an *ephemeral* (temporary) key pair.

* Alice’s private key:
  ( a = 0x1F3C...B9 )
* Bob’s private key:
  ( b = 0xA55E...4F )

Compute their public points (on the curve):

[
A = a \cdot G
]
[
B = b \cdot G
]

Where ( G ) is the base point of the curve.

Example (simplified representation):

| Party | Private key       | Public key (x,y)       |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Alice | a = `0x1F3C...B9` | A = (0x2AFB…, 0x70C2…) |
| Bob   | b = `0xA55E...4F` | B = (0xAA23…, 0xE120…) |

They exchange the **public keys A and B**.

---

### 3️⃣ Compute Shared Secret

Now, both compute:

[
S = a \cdot B = b \cdot A
]

Which gives the same point ( S = (x_s, y_s) ) on the curve.

Extract the **x-coordinate** as the shared secret:

[
Z = x_s = 0x7CFA2B1D94E...E9
]

---

### 4️⃣ Derive Session Keys

They both feed this shared secret into a **key derivation function (KDF)** along with nonces from handshake messages:

[
master_secret = \text{PRF}(Z, "master secret", ClientRandom || ServerRandom)
]

PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) uses **SHA-384** in this cipher suite.

Result example:
[
master_secret = 0xB2F3E4E8A75A9E6C2D4B0...AEF1
]

---

✅ **Result of Step 1 (Key Exchange):**
Both sides now share the same `master_secret`, without ever sending it over the network.

---

# 🧾 Step 2: Authentication — *RSA*

The server must prove its identity to the client.

---

### 1️⃣ Certificate Exchange

Server sends its **X.509 certificate**, containing:

```
Subject: CN=example.com
Public Key Algorithm: RSA
Public Key: n=0xC5C9...FAE3, e=65537
Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
```

---

### 2️⃣ Certificate Verification

Alice (the browser) verifies:

* Certificate is signed by a trusted CA
* Domain matches ("example.com")
* Signature is valid using the CA’s public key

If all checks pass → ✅ **Authentication successful**

---

### 3️⃣ Digital Signature in Handshake

The server also signs its ECDHE parameters:

[
signature = RSA_{priv}(hash(ClientRandom || ServerRandom || ECDHE_Params))
]

The client verifies using the RSA public key in the certificate.

This ensures the ECDHE public key truly came from *example.com*, not an attacker.

---

✅ **Result of Step 2 (Authentication):**
Client is sure it’s talking to the real server (identity proven via RSA).

---

# 🔐 Step 3: Encryption — *AES-256-GCM*

Now that both share a `master_secret`, they derive **session keys**:

[
key_{client_write} = 256\text{-bit key}
]
[
key_{server_write} = 256\text{-bit key}
]

Derived via KDF from the `master_secret`.

Example:

```
key_client_write = 0x5E1A09B3D6C...E98F
key_server_write = 0x92BA7ACF3B...B111
```

---

### Encrypting a TLS Record

Plaintext message:

```
"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n"
```

Nonce (unique per message):
`nonce = 0x000000000000000000000001`

Using AES-256-GCM:

[
ciphertext = AES_GCM_Encrypt(key, nonce, plaintext, AAD)
]

GCM mode does both encryption and authentication in one step.

Result:

```
ciphertext = 0x8AF9A1E4C673BDDF4C...9FE
auth_tag   = 0xF32E89D5A0C74C61B9A
```

---

✅ **Result of Step 3 (Encryption):**
Only the client and server can decrypt each other’s messages using AES-256.

---

# 🧮 Step 4: Message Authentication — *SHA-384 (via GCM)*

While older TLS versions used a separate **MAC** (e.g., HMAC-SHA256),
in **AES-GCM**, authentication is *built in*.

For each message:

* A **tag** (auth_tag) is produced from a hash of:

  * Ciphertext
  * Nonce
  * Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)
* The receiver recalculates the tag.
* If it mismatches → the message is discarded (tampered or corrupted).

---

### Example:

Message sent:

```
Ciphertext: 8AF9A1E4C673BDDF...
Auth Tag:   F32E89D5A0C74C61B9A
```

Receiver computes:

```
AES_GCM_AuthTag = F32E89D5A0C74C61B9A ✅
```

Integrity verified — message is authentic and unmodified.

---

# ✅ Final Outcome

After these four steps:

* Both sides have verified each other’s identities.
* They share symmetric keys known only to them.
* All messages are encrypted (AES-256).
* Each message is authenticated (SHA-384).
* Even if someone intercepts the data, they can’t decrypt or modify it.

Would you like me to extend this with a **packet-level Wireshark trace example** (showing real TLS handshake messages like “ClientHello”, “ServerHello”, “Certificate”, etc.) so you can see where each operation happens in a real connection?


Perfect 👏 — let’s now go **deep into a real TLS handshake**, step-by-step, showing how those **four operations (key exchange, authentication, encryption, message authentication)** appear in **actual packets** — like what you’d see in **Wireshark** during a HTTPS connection using this cipher suite:

> 🔐 **TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384**

---

## 🧭 Scenario Overview

Let’s assume:

* **Server:** example.com (with a valid RSA certificate)
* **TLS version:** 1.2
* **Cipher suite:** `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`

Wireshark captures show a typical sequence of TLS handshake messages.

* Contains an authentication tag (SHA-384) verifying integrity.

---

# 🔹 9️⃣ Server → ChangeCipherSpec + Finished

📦 **Packets: Server → Client**

Server confirms encryption and sends its own encrypted `Finished` message.

Both now have:

* Shared encryption keys (from ECDHE)

| 6     | Application Data                      | AES-256-GCM encryption + SHA-384 auth tag |

---

## ✅ End Result

Now the channel is fully secure:

* Both parties share a symmetric AES key from ECDHE.
* The server’s identity is verified via RSA.
* Every message is encrypted (AES-256-GCM).
* Each message carries an integrity tag (SHA-384).

This is exactly how HTTPS keeps your banking, login, and chat data safe.

Would you like me to go one level deeper — showing **the actual cryptographic computations** (like the derived AES key, IV, and GCM tag) using a captured TLS session’s real handshake values?
I can illustrate how Wireshark reconstructs those using the session secrets.
