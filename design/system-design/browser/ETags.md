ETags (Entity Tags) are a mechanism used by HTTP to validate cached responses efficiently. They help the browser know whether a cached copy of a resource is still fresh or needs to be downloaded again.


---

✅ What is an ETag?

An ETag is a unique identifier (usually a hash or version string) generated by the server for a specific version of a resource.

Example:

ETag: "abc123xyz"

If the file changes → the ETag changes.


---

🎯 Why ETags exist

To avoid downloading the full resource when it hasn’t changed.

🔄 How ETags work: Step-by-step

Step 1: Server sends an ETag with the response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "v1.2345"
Cache-Control: no-cache

The browser stores:

The resource

The ETag



---

Step 2: Browser wants to use cached resource

Because of no-cache, browser must revalidate first.

The browser makes a conditional request:

GET /app.js
If-None-Match: "v1.2345"


---

Step 3: Server compares ETag values

Case A — Resource hasn’t changed

ETag matches → server returns:

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified

Browser uses cached copy (zero bytes downloaded except headers).

Case B — Resource changed

ETag does not match → server returns:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "v1.6789"

Browser downloads the new file and updates its cache.

📌 ETags vs Last-Modified

Feature	ETag	Last-Modified

Precision	Strong (hash/version)	Weak (timestamp to seconds)
Detects minor changes	Yes	Maybe not
Good for heavy dynamic content	Yes	Not ideal
Best for CDN + Browser	Yes	Yes


ETags are generally more accurate.


---

🧠 Strong vs Weak ETags

Strong ETag

ETag: "abc123"

Means byte-for-byte identical.

Weak ETag

ETag: W/"abc123"

Means semantically the same (e.g., whitespace changes ignored).

CDNs often use weak ETags.


---

🌐 Where ETags are used

Browser caching

CDN caching

API gateway and REST responses

S3 object versioning

Static asset caching (JS, CSS, Images)



---

📝 Summary

ETags = version identifiers for resources.

They allow:

Faster load times

Lower bandwidth use

Smarter revalidation

Better cache consistency
