Perfect üëè ‚Äî this is a very important feature introduced in **Oracle 11g Release 2**, and it‚Äôs an excellent modern alternative to the older `CONNECT BY` syntax for hierarchical or recursive queries.

Let‚Äôs go step by step üëá

---

## üß† 1. What is the `WITH RECURSIVE` Clause?

The `WITH` clause in Oracle allows you to create **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** ‚Äî temporary result sets that exist only for the duration of a query.
When you make it **recursive**, the CTE can **refer to itself**, enabling you to handle hierarchical data, sequences, and transitive relationships ‚Äî all *within SQL*.

### üîπ Syntax:

```sql
WITH <CTE_name> (<column_list>) AS (
    <anchor_query>           -- Base case
    UNION ALL
    <recursive_query>        -- Recursive step (refers to CTE itself)
)
SELECT * FROM <CTE_name>;
```

## üß© 2. Components Explained

| Part                | Meaning                                                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Anchor query**    | Base case that starts the recursion (non-recursive SELECT)          |
| **Recursive query** | Refers to the CTE itself and defines how to go to the next level    |
| **UNION ALL**       | Combines the base case and recursive step results                   |
| **Termination**     | Oracle stops recursion when the recursive query returns no new rows |

## üí° 3. Simple Example ‚Äî Employee Hierarchy

Suppose we have a table:

| EMP_ID | NAME  | MANAGER_ID |
| :----- | :---- | :--------- |
| 1      | Alice | NULL       |
| 2      | Bob   | 1          |
| 3      | Carol | 2          |
| 4      | Dave  | 2          |
| 5      | Eve   | 3          |

---

### Query using `WITH RECURSIVE`:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy (emp_id, name, manager_id, level_num) AS (
    -- Anchor: top-level managers
    SELECT emp_id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level_num
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive: get subordinates of previous level
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level_num + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy h
        ON e.manager_id = h.emp_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

### ‚úÖ Output:

| EMP_ID | NAME  | MANAGER_ID | LEVEL_NUM |
| :----- | :---- | :--------- | :-------- |
| 1      | Alice | NULL       | 1         |
| 2      | Bob   | 1          | 2         |
| 3      | Carol | 2          | 3         |
| 4      | Dave  | 2          | 3         |
| 5      | Eve   | 3          | 4         |

## üîÑ 4. How It Works (Step-by-Step)

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Step 1: Anchor Query] -->|manager_id IS NULL| B[Find Alice]
  B --> C[Step 2: Recursive Query - employees with manager_id = Alice's ID]
  C --> D[Add Bob (level 2)]
  D --> E[Next recursion - employees with manager_id = Bob's ID]
  E --> F[Add Carol, Dave (level 3)]
  F --> G[Next recursion - employees with manager_id = Carol's ID]
  G --> H[Add Eve (level 4)]
  H --> I[Stop (no new rows)]
```

So it builds the hierarchy **level by level** ‚Äî just like recursion in programming.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Comparison: `CONNECT BY` vs `WITH RECURSIVE`

| Feature                                | `CONNECT BY`             | `WITH RECURSIVE`                                         |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax                                 | Oracle-specific          | ANSI SQL standard                                        |
| Recursion Depth                        | Limited, harder to debug | Easier to control and debug                              |
| Readability                            | Compact but rigid        | Flexible and clearer                                     |
| Multiple parents / complex hierarchies | Hard                     | Easier with JOIN logic                                   |
| Portability                            | Oracle only              | Works across modern RDBMS (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.) |
| Advanced conditions                    | Limited                  | Can add filters, computations easily                     |

## üßÆ 6. Example ‚Äî Generating a Sequence (Non-hierarchical recursion)

You can use recursion to generate numbers dynamically:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE numbers(n) AS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM dual
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM numbers
    WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT * FROM numbers;
```

‚úÖ Output:

| N   |
| :-- |
| 1   |
| 2   |
| ... |
| 10  |

## üß† 7. Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                       | Example                             |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Organizational Hierarchies** | Employees reporting to managers     |
| **Bill of Materials (BOM)**    | Parts/subparts relationship         |
| **Graph Traversal**            | Network relationships, dependencies |
| **Path Finding**               | File directory structures           |
| **Sequence generation**        | Iterative data without tables       |

---

## üöÄ 8. Performance & Optimization Tips

* Use **`UNION ALL`** (not `UNION`) to avoid sorting and deduplication overhead.
* Add a **termination condition** (e.g., `WHERE n < limit`) to prevent infinite recursion.
* Index join columns (e.g., `manager_id`, `emp_id`) for better performance.
* Use **`SEARCH DEPTH FIRST`** or **`BREADTH FIRST`** clause (Oracle 12c+) to control traversal order.

Example:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy (...) AS (
  ...
)
SEARCH DEPTH FIRST BY name SET order_col
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY order_col;
```
