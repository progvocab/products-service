Here are some important system design questions that are often asked during technical interviews or when designing real-world systems:

### 1. **Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)**
   - How do you store and generate unique short URLs?
   - How do you handle collisions (if two URLs hash to the same short code)?
   - How would you handle massive scale (millions of requests per second)?
   - How to handle expiration of URLs or analytics for usage?

### 2. **Design a Distributed Cache (like Memcached/Redis)**
   - What type of data structures would you use for caching?
   - How would you ensure data consistency across multiple cache nodes?
   - How would you handle cache invalidation?
   - What strategy would you use for cache eviction (e.g., LRU, LFU)?
   - How would you handle failures and ensure high availability?

### 3. **Design an E-commerce Platform**
   - How do you design the product catalog and inventory system?
   - How do you handle user authentication, carts, and payments?
   - How would you scale for high traffic during events (e.g., Black Friday)?
   - How would you handle recommendation systems for personalized shopping experiences?

### 4. **Design a Social Media Feed (like Facebook or Twitter)**
   - How do you design the feed system to handle personalized content for each user?
   - How do you rank and filter content for relevance?
   - How would you handle real-time updates and notifications?
   - How do you scale for a large number of concurrent users?

### 5. **Design an Online Bookstore (like Amazon)**
   - How would you design the search and recommendation engine?
   - How do you handle transactions and order management?
   - How would you ensure the system scales with a growing number of users and products?
   - How would you handle the inventory system and warehouse management?

### 6. **Design a Ride-Sharing Service (like Uber or Lyft)**
   - How would you match drivers and riders efficiently?
   - How do you design a real-time location tracking system?
   - How would you ensure scalability as the user base grows?
   - How do you design the pricing algorithm and surge pricing?

### 7. **Design a Scalable Notification System**
   - How do you handle millions of notifications per second (email, SMS, push notifications)?
   - How do you design for multiple types of notifications (real-time vs batch)?
   - How do you ensure delivery guarantees (at-least-once, at-most-once)?
   - How do you manage user preferences and notification settings?

### 8. **Design a Video Streaming Platform (like YouTube or Netflix)**
   - How would you handle video storage and content delivery?
   - How do you design for low-latency video streaming across different geographies?
   - How would you implement a recommendation engine?
   - How would you handle copyright and DRM for videos?

### 9. **Design a Search Engine**
   - How would you crawl and index billions of web pages?
   - How would you rank search results and provide relevant suggestions?
   - How would you handle real-time updates (e.g., breaking news)?
   - How do you ensure the system can scale to handle large query loads?

### 10. **Design a Messaging System (like WhatsApp or Slack)**
   - How would you ensure real-time message delivery?
   - How would you design for group chats and message broadcasting?
   - How would you handle offline messages and message retries?
   - How would you ensure end-to-end encryption and security?

### 11. **Design a File Storage System (like Google Drive or Dropbox)**
   - How would you handle storage, retrieval, and versioning of files?
   - How would you ensure data consistency and replication across multiple data centers?
   - How do you handle user authentication and access control?
   - How would you design for scalability with growing file sizes and users?

### 12. **Design a Payment Processing System**
   - How would you handle transactions and ensure security?
   - How would you design for high availability and fault tolerance?
   - How do you prevent fraud and handle chargebacks?
   - How would you scale to handle millions of transactions per second?

### 13. **Design a Logging System**
   - How do you store and process large volumes of log data?
   - How would you ensure fast querying and retrieval of logs?
   - How do you handle log aggregation from multiple services?
   - How would you design the system for analytics and alerting on logs?

### 14. **Design a Rate Limiting System**
   - How do you enforce rate limits on APIs for individual users or IPs?
   - How would you handle distributed rate limiting across multiple servers?
   - How do you prevent abuse while ensuring legitimate users are not blocked?
   - How would you scale the system for millions of requests per second?

### 15. **Design a Cloud File Sync Service**
   - How would you keep files synchronized across devices?
   - How would you handle conflicts when multiple users edit the same file?
   - How would you ensure data integrity and consistency?
   - How would you handle large-scale replication and file versioning?

These questions are designed to test knowledge in areas such as scalability, fault tolerance, consistency, and distributed systems. Being able to articulate trade-offs and design decisions is key in answering them effectively.
