The **STAR method** is Amazon’s preferred way to evaluate candidates during interviews, especially for **behavioral (LP)** questions.
It ensures your answers are **structured, concise, and focused on real impact**.

Here is a clean, crisp explanation and example tailored for Amazon interviews:

---

# ⭐ **STAR Method (Amazon Behavioral Interviews)**

Amazon evaluates candidates heavily on **Leadership Principles (LPs)**.
The STAR method helps you answer with **clarity, ownership, and measurable results**.

---

## ✅ **S — Situation**

*Set the context.*

* What was happening?
* Why was it important?
* What was at stake?

**Tip:** Keep it short (2–3 lines).

---

## ✅ **T — Task**

*What was your responsibility?*

* What were you expected to deliver?
* What was your role?

**Tip:** Clarify your ownership explicitly.

---

## ✅ **A — Action**

*What did YOU do?*

* The decisions you made
* The steps you took
* How you solved the problem

**Tip:** 70% of your answer should be this.

---

## ✅ **R — Result**

*What happened because of your actions?*

* Quantify results (%, $, time saved, performance improved)
* What you learned
* Any recognition or reuse of your solution

**Tip:** Amazon loves metrics.

# 🔥 **STAR Example for Amazon (Leadership Principle: Ownership)**

### **Question:**

“Tell me about a time when you had to take ownership of a problem that wasn’t technically your responsibility.”

### **STAR Answer:**

**S – Situation:**
Our data pipeline frequently failed during month-end processing, causing reporting delays for finance.

**T – Task:**
Although it wasn’t my team’s component, I needed to ensure stable reporting because other teams depended on our output.

**A – Action:**

* Investigated logs and found a bottleneck in the ETL transformation step
* Jumped in to fix the job configuration and rewrote the slow SQL query
* Created an automated alert and retry mechanism
* Coordinated with the owning team and documented the permanent fix

**R – Result:**

* Reduced job runtime by **65%**
* Eliminated month-end failures for the next **8 cycles**
* Finance team delivered reports **1 day earlier**
* My fix became a template for similar ETL jobs
