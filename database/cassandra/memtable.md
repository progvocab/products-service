### **What is a Memtable?**  
A **Memtable** is an in-memory **key-value store** used in **NoSQL databases** and **log-structured storage systems** like **Apache Cassandra, LevelDB, and RocksDB**. It acts as a **write buffer**, storing new writes in memory before they are flushed to **disk-based storage** (e.g., SSTables in Cassandra).  

---

## **How Memtable Works**
1. **Write Operation:**  
   - Data is first written to a **Commit Log** (to ensure durability).  
   - Then, it is written to the **Memtable** (fast in-memory structure).  

2. **Read Operation:**  
   - If data is **recent**, it is served from the **Memtable**.  
   - If not found, the database checks **SSTables (on disk)**.  

3. **Flush to Disk (SSTable):**  
   - When the **Memtable reaches a threshold size**, it is **flushed to disk** as an **SSTable (Sorted String Table)**.  
   - A new Memtable is created, and old Memtables become **read-only** until they are **compacted**.

## **Advantages of Memtable**
✅ **Fast Writes:** Since writes happen in-memory, they are much faster than disk operations.  
✅ **Efficient Reads:** Frequently accessed data remains in memory, reducing disk reads.  
✅ **Batch Disk Writes:** Instead of writing every change to disk, it flushes in bulk, reducing I/O overhead.

## **Memtable vs. Other Data Structures**
| Feature           | Memtable (Cassandra) | Write-Ahead Log (WAL) | Page Cache (Traditional DBs) |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Temporary in-memory store for fast writes | Ensures durability | Caches frequently used disk pages |
| **Persistence**  | No (Flushed to SSTables) | Yes (Written to disk) | No (Evicted as needed) |
| **Performance**  | High (in-memory) | Slower (disk-based) | Medium |

## **Example: Memtable in Apache Cassandra**
- Uses **SSTables + Memtables** for high-performance writes.  
- **Writes go to a Commit Log + Memtable** before being flushed to disk.  
- **Memtables use structures like Red-Black Trees** for fast key lookups.

### **Conclusion**
Memtables **speed up writes** and **optimize reads** in modern databases. They work as an **intermediate buffer**, preventing frequent disk writes while ensuring durability with a **commit log**.
