Great question 👌. Let’s carefully connect **Euclidean distance** with **similarity**.

---

### 🔹 Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance between two points $x$ and $y$ in $n$-dimensional space is:

$$
d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}
$$

* Smaller distance → points are closer → more **similar**.
* Larger distance → points are farther apart → less **similar**.

So **similarity is inversely related to distance**.

---

### 🔹 Turning Distance into Similarity

Euclidean distance itself measures *dissimilarity*. To use it as a similarity measure, we usually transform it:

1. **Inverse transformation**

   $$
   \text{similarity}(x,y) = \frac{1}{1 + d(x,y)}
   $$

   * Range: $(0, 1]$.
   * Identical points → similarity = 1.
   * Far away → similarity → 0.

2. **Exponential (Gaussian kernel)**

   $$
   \text{similarity}(x,y) = e^{-\frac{d(x,y)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
   $$

   * Popular in machine learning (RBF kernels).
   * $\sigma$ controls how fast similarity decreases with distance.

---

### 🔹 Example

Suppose we have two vectors:

$$
x = (1, 2), \quad y = (2, 3)
$$

* Euclidean distance:

  $$
  d(x,y) = \sqrt{(1-2)^2 + (2-3)^2} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41
  $$

* Similarity (inverse form):

  $$
  \text{similarity}(x,y) = \frac{1}{1+1.41} \approx 0.41
  $$

If we compare with another point $z = (10, 10)$:

$$
d(x,z) = \sqrt{(1-10)^2 + (2-10)^2} = \sqrt{81+64} = \sqrt{145} \approx 12.04
$$

$$
\text{similarity}(x,z) = \frac{1}{1+12.04} \approx 0.077
$$

So $x$ and $y$ are much more similar than $x$ and $z$.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Euclidean distance measures *how far apart* two points are.
* To interpret it as *similarity*, invert or rescale it.
* The smaller the distance, the higher the similarity.

Do you want me to also show how **Euclidean-based similarity compares with cosine similarity** on the same vectors? That would highlight the difference between "closeness in space" vs. "closeness in direction."


Perfect — let’s ground this in **machine learning and similarity search** 🚀.

When we say **similarity using Euclidean distance** in ML, we’re usually dealing with **feature vectors** (embeddings, representations of text, images, users, etc.).

## 🔹 Euclidean Distance in ML & Similarity Search

### 1. **As a similarity metric**

* ML models often map raw data (text, image, audio) into a **vector space** (embeddings).
* Two items are “similar” if their vectors are **close together** in this space.
* Closeness is usually measured by **Euclidean distance**:

  $$
  d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - y_i)^2}
  $$

👉 Example:
In a face recognition system (like FaceNet), the network outputs a **128-dimensional vector** per face.

* If Euclidean distance between two embeddings < threshold (say 0.9), the faces are considered the same person.

---

### 2. **As a retrieval method (k-NN search)**

* In **similarity search**, databases (e.g., FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate) store millions of embeddings.
* To find the **most similar items**, they:

  * Compute Euclidean distance (or another metric) between the query embedding and all stored embeddings.
  * Return the **k-nearest neighbors** (k smallest distances).

👉 Example:
Search “cat picture” → CNN extracts embedding → find stored embeddings with smallest Euclidean distance → return top-k most similar cat images.

---

### 3. **Issues in ML with Euclidean distance**

* **High dimensions**: In very high-dimensional embeddings (hundreds or thousands), Euclidean distances tend to **concentrate** (all points seem equally far).
* **Magnitude sensitivity**: Euclidean distance depends on vector lengths. Two vectors pointing in the same direction but with different scales may seem dissimilar.

---

### 4. **Alternatives**

That’s why in similarity search we often use:

* **Cosine similarity**: focuses on *angle/direction* of vectors (scale-invariant).
* **Dot product similarity**: common in recommendation models.
* **Mahalanobis distance**: adjusts for feature correlations.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaway

* **Euclidean distance works well when embeddings are normalized and dimensionality is moderate.**
* In practice, many ML systems **L2-normalize embeddings first**, so Euclidean distance and cosine similarity become equivalent.

---

Would you like me to illustrate this with a **Python example** using embeddings (say, with NumPy) showing how Euclidean vs. Cosine similarity behave in similarity search?
