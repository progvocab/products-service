Almost right ✅ — but let’s refine it a bit because **tensor** isn’t always 4D.

---

## **1. Vector**

* **Definition**: 1D array of numbers.
* Shape: `(n,)` (or sometimes `(1, n)` / `(n, 1)` if forced into 2D).
* Example:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  v = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # shape = (3,)
  ```

---

## **2. Matrix**

* **Definition**: 2D array (rows × columns).
* Shape: `(m, n)`
* Example:

  ```python
  M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])   # shape = (2, 3)
  ```

---

## **3. Tensor**

* **Definition**: Generalization of vectors & matrices to **n dimensions** (n ≥ 3).
* Shape: Can be **3D, 4D, 5D...** depending on the problem.
* Example:

  * **3D tensor** → batch of word embeddings `(batch, sequence_length, embedding_dim)`
  * **4D tensor** → batch of images `(batch, channels, height, width)`
  * **5D tensor** → batch of video frames `(batch, frames, height, width, channels)`

In PyTorch / TensorFlow, everything is a **tensor** — vectors are 1D tensors, matrices are 2D tensors, images are often 4D tensors.

## **4. Visual Summary**

| Name            | Dimensions | Example              |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| **Scalar**      | 0D         | `7`                  |
| **Vector**      | 1D         | `[1, 2, 3]`          |
| **Matrix**      | 2D         | `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`  |
| **Tensor (3D)** | 3D         | `batch of sequences` |
| **Tensor (4D)** | 4D         | `batch of images`    |
| **Tensor (5D)** | 5D         | `batch of videos`    |

---

✅ So:

* Vector = 1D
* Matrix = 2D
* Tensor = nD (3D, 4D, 5D, … depending on problem)

---

Do you want me to show you a **NumPy example that builds scalar → vector → matrix → tensor step by step** so you can see the shapes directly?
Good question 👍 — let’s carefully build up from **matrix operations** and see how they can result in **higher-dimensional tensors**.

---

## **1. Reminder: Shapes**

* **Matrix** → 2D (rows × columns)
* **Tensor** → nD (n ≥ 3)

When you combine or stack matrices, you can naturally produce **tensors**.

---

## **2. Example 1: Stacking Matrices → 3D Tensor**

Suppose we have 2 matrices, each of shape `(2, 3)`:

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])   # shape = (2, 3)

B = np.array([[7, 8, 9],
              [10, 11, 12]])  # shape = (2, 3)

# Stack along a new axis
tensor = np.stack([A, B])  # shape = (2, 2, 3)

print(tensor.shape)
```

🔹 Here, stacking 2 matrices gave a **3D tensor**.

* Axis 0 → which matrix (A or B)
* Axis 1 → rows
* Axis 2 → columns

---

## **3. Example 2: Batch of Matrix Multiplications → 3D Tensor**

Let’s say you’re doing **batch matrix multiplication**, common in ML.

```python
# Batch of 2 pairs of matrices
batch_A = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4)  # 2 matrices of shape (3,4)
batch_B = np.random.randn(2, 4, 5)  # 2 matrices of shape (4,5)

# Perform batched matrix multiplication
result = np.matmul(batch_A, batch_B)

print(result.shape)  # (2, 3, 5)
```

🔹 Each multiplication `(3×4)·(4×5)` → `(3×5)` matrix
🔹 With 2 batches → **3D tensor of shape (2, 3, 5)**

---

## **4. Example 3: Outer Product of Vectors → Matrix, then Tensor**

* Outer product of 2 vectors → Matrix
* Outer product of 3 vectors → Tensor

```python
x = np.array([1, 2])     # shape = (2,)
y = np.array([3, 4, 5])  # shape = (3,)
z = np.array([6, 7])     # shape = (2,)

# First outer product: matrix
M = np.outer(x, y)  # shape = (2,3)

# Outer with third vector: tensor
T = np.einsum('i,j,k->ijk', x, y, z)  # shape = (2,3,2)

print(T.shape)
```

🔹 Now you have a **3D tensor (2×3×2)** from three vectors.

---

✅ **Summary**

* Stacking matrices → higher-dimensional tensor
* Batch matrix multiplication → 3D tensor
* Outer products of multiple vectors → tensor

---

Would you like me to also show a **real ML example** (like batch of image transformations, where each operation on matrices produces a 4D tensor)?
