I wasn’t able to locate a **single book** that provides a formalized taxonomy of terminology such as **“decommissioning,” “sunset,”** and similar states right within its chapters. However, these phases are well-documented across software lifecycle and product management literature, as well as protocol and process frameworks. Below are some well-recognized books and frameworks where such states—while not always labeled identically—are covered in depth:

### Recommended Reading & Sources

#### 1. **Enterprise Unified Process (EUP)** — *"The Enterprise Unified Process: Extending the Rational Unified Process"* by **Scott W. Ambler**

* The **Retirement Phase** (also referred to as decommissioning, sunsetting, or system retirement) is a core part of the EUP lifecycle, where a system or release is removed from production.([enterpriseunifiedprocess.com][1])
* Offers detailed guidance on activities like migration planning, documentation updates, testing, stakeholder coordination, and archival steps—all central to proper system sunsetting.

---

#### 2. **Software Lifecycle & Product Management Publications**

* A scholarly paper titled **“The Sun also Sets: Ending the Life of a Software Product”** outlines the **sunsetting process** (phase-out, end-of-life) and provides a method-driven approach plus real-world retrospective case studies. This paper is often cited in discussions about software planning and product portfolio strategy.([Slinger Jansen Research Page][2])

#### 3. **Industry Guidelines & Lifecycle Checklists**

* While not formal books, numerous enterprise strategy blogs and guidelines outline phased concepts—including end-of-support, sunset, retirement, obsolescence, and decommissioning—in contexts like IT asset management and product feature planning. For example:

  * A financial institutions guide to **IT asset end-of-life (EOL)** that enumerates various phase terms and regulatory implications.([Tandem][3])
  * Product planning frameworks with **10-step EOL checklists**, categorizing planning, communication, and execution phases.([ProductPlan][4])

### Suggested Next Steps

If you're looking for **formal definitions** and **structured process guidance**, the **EUP book by Scott Ambler** is your best starting point—it’s comprehensive and directly addresses system retirement phases.

For a more **method-driven, reflective approach**, the *“Sun also Sets…”* paper provides frameworks and real-world evaluation—great for structuring sunsetting projects.

Let me know if you’d like help locating academic publications, frameworks like ITIL, or industry standards that define these phases even more precisely!
