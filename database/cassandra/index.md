Yes, **Apache Cassandra** allows creating indexes, but **secondary indexes** in Cassandra work differently compared to relational databases. They are **not always the best choice** due to performance trade-offs.  

---

## **🔹 Types of Indexes in Cassandra**
### **1️⃣ Secondary Index (Built-In)**
Cassandra allows creating secondary indexes on **non-primary key columns**, but they are inefficient for large datasets.  
✅ **Best for:** Low-cardinality columns (few unique values).  
❌ **Avoid for:** High-cardinality columns (many unique values, like timestamps).  

🔹 **Example: Creating a Secondary Index**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees (department);
```
🔹 **Query Using the Index**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
```
🚨 **Limitations:**  
- Can lead to **full table scans** if the data is spread across many nodes.  
- Slower for high-cardinality columns.  

---

### **2️⃣ Materialized Views (Precomputed Queries)**
A **Materialized View (MV)** precomputes and stores data in a new table for fast lookups.  
✅ **Best for:** Read-heavy queries on non-primary key columns.  
❌ **Downside:** **Increases storage** and **slows down writes**.  

🔹 **Example: Creating a Materialized View**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employees_by_department AS
SELECT employee_id, name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NOT NULL
PRIMARY KEY (department, employee_id);
```
🔹 **Query Using the View**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees_by_department WHERE department = 'HR';
```

---

### **3️⃣ SASI (SSTable Attached Secondary Index)**
Cassandra introduced **SASI indexes** for better query performance compared to traditional indexes.  
✅ **Best for:** Partial text searches and range queries.  
❌ **Avoid if:** High write throughput is needed (can slow writes).  

🔹 **Example: Creating a SASI Index**
```sql
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX idx_name ON employees (name)
USING 'org.apache.cassandra.index.sasi.SASIIndex';
```
🔹 **Query Using SASI**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

🚨 **Limitations:**  
- Slower than partition key lookups.  
- Not ideal for frequently updated columns.

## **🔹 When to Use Which Index?**
| **Index Type**  | **Best For**  | **Avoid When** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Secondary Index** | Low-cardinality columns (e.g., boolean flags) | High-cardinality columns, large datasets |
| **Materialized View** | Read-heavy workloads | If storage and write latency are concerns |
| **SASI Index** | Text search, range queries | If fast writes are required |

---

## **🔹 Best Practice: Use Denormalization Instead of Indexes**
In Cassandra, the **best way to optimize queries** is to **denormalize** data by **creating separate tables for different queries** instead of relying on indexes.

✅ **Example: Creating a Query-Optimized Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees_by_department (
    department TEXT,
    employee_id UUID,
    name TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (department, employee_id)
);
```
✅ **Fast Query**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees_by_department WHERE department = 'HR';
```
✔ **Much faster than using an index** because **it avoids full table scans**.

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- **Yes, Cassandra supports indexes**, but they should be used **carefully**.
- **Avoid secondary indexes for high-cardinality columns**.
- **Materialized Views and SASI indexes can be useful**, but they have trade-offs.
- **Denormalization is often the best solution** for performance.
