Here’s a full explanation + optimal solution for **LeetCode 3229 — Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target**.

---

## Problem Restatement

You have two integer arrays `nums` and `target`, of equal length `n`. In one operation, you can choose **any contiguous subarray** of `nums` and either **increment every element** in that subarray by 1 or **decrement every element** by 1.

You want to transform `nums` into `target` using the **fewest operations**. Return that minimum number.

---

## Key Insights & Why Greedy Works

1. Compute the *difference array*:

   $$
   \text{diff}[i] = \; target[i] - nums[i]
   $$

   Each position `i` needs to shift by `diff[i]` (positive means increase, negative means decrease).

2. You can apply operations on contiguous subarrays. If two adjacent positions `i - 1` and `i` have differences of the **same sign**, then some operations can be shared between them — you can “stretch” an operation across both.

3. However, if the sign changes (one needs an increase, the next needs a decrease, or vice versa), you can’t combine those operations. You need to start fresh when the sign changes.

4. Also, when `|diff[i]|` is larger than `|diff[i - 1]|`, you’ll need extra operations beyond what was “common” with previous.

From these observations, a greedy strategy emerges:

* Start at `i = 0`, take `|diff[0]|` operations for that element (because nothing to share from the left).
* For each `i > 0`, look at `diff[i]` and `diff[i-1]`:

  * If both are ≥ 0 (both need increments), then extra operations = `max(0, diff[i] − diff[i-1])`
  * If both ≤ 0 (both need decrements), then extra operations = `max(0, |diff[i]| − |diff[i-1]|)`
  * If they have **different signs** (one needs increase, the other decrease), you can’t share anything: add in full `|diff[i]|`

Sum all these to get the total number of operations.

## Solution (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: list[int], target: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        # diff array
        diff0 = target[0] - nums[0]
        # Start with the operations needed for the first position
        ops = abs(diff0)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            d = target[i] - nums[i]
            prev = target[i - 1] - nums[i - 1]
            
            # If both current and previous diffs are non-negative
            if d >= 0 and prev >= 0:
                # We only need extra if current diff is larger than prev
                ops += max(0, d - prev)
            # If both non-positive (decrements)
            elif d <= 0 and prev <= 0:
                # Compare absolute values
                ops += max(0, abs(d) - abs(prev))
            else:
                # Sign change: can't share operations
                ops += abs(d)
        
        return ops
```

## Explanation with an Example

Suppose:

```text
nums = [3, 5, 1, 2]
target = [4, 6, 2, 4]
```

* diff = `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
* For i = 0 → need `abs(1) = 1` op
* i = 1 → prev = 1, curr = 1, both ≥ 0 → extra = max(0, 1 − 1) = 0
* i = 2 → prev = 1, curr = 1 → extra = 0
* i = 3 → prev = 1, curr = 2 → extra = max(0, 2 − 1) = 1

Sum = `1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2` → matches the sample answer.

---

## Time & Space Complexity

* **Time:** $O(n)$ — one pass over the arrays.
* **Space:** $O(1)$ extra (beyond diff calculation, using a constant number of variables).

If you like, I can also show you a proof sketch for *why you can’t do better* than this greedy strategy, or walk you through a more complicated example to illustrate shared operations in depth.


Great follow-up 👍. For **LeetCode 3229 (Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target)**, the greedy solution I showed is the most natural — but there are other **equivalent optimal formulations** of the same idea. Let’s look at them.

---

# 🔹 1. **Prefix Difference (Slope) View**

Instead of working directly with `diff[i]`, look at the *change* between adjacent elements:

$$
\Delta[i] = \text{diff}[i] - \text{diff}[i-1] \quad \text{(with diff[-1] = 0)}
$$

* Why? Each operation on a subarray `[l, r]` increases `diff[l]` by ±1, decreases `diff[r+1]` by ±1, and leaves middle unchanged.
* That means the “cost” is exactly the sum of absolute changes in this difference array.

✅ Formula:

$$
\text{operations} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \max(0, \; |diff[i]| - |diff[i-1]| \; \text{if same sign, else } |diff[i]| )
$$

This is exactly what the greedy does, but it can be expressed more cleanly as:

$$
\text{operations} = |diff[0]| + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \max(0, \; |diff[i]| - \text{sgn}(diff[i]) \cdot \text{sgn}(diff[i-1]) \cdot |diff[i-1]| )
$$

So instead of scanning with case checks, you can reduce it to one formula.

---

# 🔹 2. **Total Variation Formula**

Another way: think of the transformation as “pushing” operations from left to right.

* The total operations required =

  * operations to create `diff[0]`
  * plus all **increases in magnitude** when moving from `diff[i-1]` to `diff[i]`.

So:

$$
\text{operations} = |diff[0]| + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \max(0, |diff[i]| - |diff[i-1]|) \quad \text{if same sign}
$$

and if the sign changes, you restart fresh: add `|diff[i]|`.

This is still greedy, but you can think of it as computing the **total variation of diff** across sign-consistent segments.

---

# 🔹 3. **Segment Decomposition (Monotone Stack Analogy)**

* Break `diff` into maximal consecutive segments of same sign.
* For each segment `[l..r]`, operations = `max(diff[l..r])` if positive, or `max(|diff[l..r]|)` if negative.
* Sum over all segments.

This works because within a monotone sign block, you can “stack” operations and share them.

It’s equivalent to greedy but feels closer to **range DP**.

---

# 🔹 4. **DP Formulation (Not Needed, but Valid)**

You *can* define:

$$
dp[i] = \text{min ops to make nums[:i] equal to target[:i]}
$$

and transition depending on whether you extend the previous subarray ops or start new ones.
But the DP collapses into the greedy formula because choices are forced by the sign-change property.

⚠️ Complexity: `O(n)` anyway, but more cumbersome.

---

## ✅ Takeaway

* The **greedy left-to-right** algorithm is the cleanest implementation.
* But you can reframe it:

  1. As a **prefix difference (slope)** problem,
  2. As a **total variation** calculation,
  3. As a **segment decomposition** across sign-consistent blocks.
* All are equivalent and **provably optimal** — the difference is just in perspective.

Would you like me to **show the segment-based solution in code** (breaking into blocks of same sign) so you can see an alternative implementation that doesn’t look like greedy scanning?
