The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** categorizes projects into three maturity levels: **Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated**. These levels indicate the project's adoption, stability, governance, and overall maturity.

---

## **1. Sandbox Project**  
**ðŸ”¹ Early-stage projects**  
- New and experimental projects in cloud-native computing.  
- Not yet widely adopted but have potential.  
- Developers can experiment, contribute, and test feasibility.  

**ðŸ”¹ Requirements to Become a Sandbox Project**  
- Must align with CNCFâ€™s mission.  
- Have a healthy **open-source community** and public roadmap.  
- Must be unique or provide significant benefits over existing CNCF projects.  

**ðŸ”¹ Examples of CNCF Sandbox Projects**  
- **Backstage** (Developer portals)  
- **Cilium** (eBPF-powered networking)  

---

## **2. Incubating Project**  
**ðŸ”¹ Growing projects with early adoption**  
- More stable and gaining industry adoption.  
- Must follow **CNCF best practices** (security, governance, documentation).  
- May have commercial support from vendors.  

**ðŸ”¹ Requirements to Become an Incubating Project**  
- Real-world production use in multiple organizations.  
- Clear **governance model** and contributor community.  
- Must pass a **security review**.  

**ðŸ”¹ Examples of CNCF Incubating Projects**  
- **Argo** (GitOps & CI/CD)  
- **OpenTelemetry** (Observability)  

---

## **3. Graduated Project**  
**ðŸ”¹ Fully mature and widely adopted**  
- Used in **large-scale production environments**.  
- Proven track record of security, governance, and long-term support.  
- Strong, sustainable **open-source community**.  

**ðŸ”¹ Requirements to Become a Graduated Project**  
- Must follow **CNCF best practices** (security, governance, open-source contributions).  
- Adopted by **multiple enterprises** and cloud providers.  
- Must have a **strong contributor base** and a **well-defined governance model**.  

**ðŸ”¹ Examples of CNCF Graduated Projects**  
- **Kubernetes** (Container orchestration)  
- **Prometheus** (Monitoring)  
- **Envoy** (Service mesh)

## **Summary Table**
| CNCF Stage  | Maturity Level | Adoption | Examples |
|------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Sandbox** | Experimental & Early-stage | Low | Backstage, Cilium |
| **Incubating** | Growing & Gaining Adoption | Medium | Argo, OpenTelemetry |
| **Graduated** | Fully Mature & Widely Used | High | Kubernetes, Prometheus |

### **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Sandbox** â†’ **New and experimental**, open for contributions.  
âœ… **Incubating** â†’ **Growing adoption**, proven use cases.  
âœ… **Graduated** â†’ **Stable, widely adopted**, industry standard.  

Graduated projects are **battle-tested** and production-ready, while sandbox and incubating projects are in earlier stages of adoption.
