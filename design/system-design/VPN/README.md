# **VPN**
## System Design 
### Flow between client, VPN server, authentication, encryption, and final destination.

    subgraph ClientSide["Client Device"]
        A[User Application] --> B[VPN Client]
        B --> C[Encryption Module]
        C --> D[Tunnel Protocol]
    end

    D -->|Encrypted Tunnel| E[Internet]

    subgraph VPNServer["VPN Server"]
        F[Decryption Module] --> G[Authentication Service]
        G --> H[Access Control & Firewall]
        H --> I[Routing Engine]
    end

    E --> F

    I --> J[Destination Server/Website]
    J --> I --> F -->|Encrypted Response| D
```

### Explanation of Flow:

1. **Client Device**

   * User runs a VPN client â†’ encrypts traffic using chosen tunnel protocol.

2. **Internet**

   * All traffic moves in encrypted form, preventing snooping.

3. **VPN Server**

   * Decrypts the traffic.
   * Authenticates the user (via certificates, keys, or credentials).
   * Applies firewall and access rules.
   * Routes traffic to destination.

4. **Destination Server**

   * Sees traffic as coming from VPN server (not client).

5. **Response Path**

   * Data flows back through the same tunnel, encrypted end-to-end.

Do you want me to also draw a **detailed version with multiple clients connecting to a VPN cluster (load balancer, multiple servers, logs, monitoring)** for production-scale design?
