# What a Model Context Protocol (MCP) **server** is — explained in detail

**Short definition (one line):** an **MCP server** is a service that *exposes tools, resources, and prompts* to LLM-driven apps via the open **Model Context Protocol** (MCP). It lets an AI client discover what tools exist and invoke them in a structured, auditable, and secure way. ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 1) The idea (why it exists)

Before MCP, every LLM app had to write custom "plugin" code for each external API, data source, or tool. MCP standardizes that plumbing so an LLM (or an LLM-hosting app) can connect to *any* MCP-conformant server and safely discover and call tools without bespoke adapters. Think “USB-C for AI tools.” ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 2) The protocol & primitives (how it works)

* **Transport & message format:** MCP uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** messages over supported transports (HTTP/SSE, stdio, etc.). The spec defines stateful connections, capability negotiation, and utility messages (progress, cancel, logging). ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Three main primitives a server exposes:**

  * **Tools** — executable functions (with JSON Schema for inputs/outputs).
  * **Resources** — read-only contextual data (documents, metadata).
  * **Prompts** — templated prompts or workflows the server can provide for better elicitation. ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Discovery + invocation:** clients request `tools/list` (discover available tools) and call tools with `tools/call` (or the analogous JSON-RPC methods). The spec includes paging for listings and structured result objects (including `isError` and `structuredContent`). Example request/response patterns are in the spec. ([Model Context Protocol][2])

---

## 3) Typical MCP server architecture & components

A production MCP server usually contains:

* **Tool registry** (metadata + JSON Schema for each tool)
* **Tool adapters / handlers** (the code that executes the tool: API calls, DB queries, commands)
* **Resource store** (documents, cached query results, file access)
* **Prompt library** (templated prompts & examples)
* **Auth & consent layer** (OAuth, per-user authorization, “approve tool call” UI)
* **Transport layer** (JSON-RPC over HTTP/SSE or stdio for local integrations)
* **Observability & auditing** (tool-call logs, results, error traces)
* **Rate-limiting, quotas, and per-tool policy enforcement**
  These align with the MCP spec’s guidance on features and security. ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 4) Security, consent & safety (required design thinking)

The MCP spec emphasizes **strong security and consent** because tools can access data or perform actions. Key requirements include:

* explicit **user consent** before exposing or invoking sensitive resources,
* **least privilege** (per-tool ACLs and per-user scope),
* **never leaking prompts** to servers unless explicitly allowed,
* treating tool descriptions as *untrusted* metadata (i.e., hosts should not blindly trust a server’s description of what a tool does). ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 5) Wire examples (the canonical flow)

**Discovery** (JSON-RPC `tools/list`):

```json
{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"tools/list", "params":{ "cursor": null } }
```

**Invoke** (JSON-RPC `tools/call`):

```json
{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":2, "method":"tools/call",
  "params":{ "name":"get_weather","arguments":{"location":"New York"} } }
```

Responses contain structured results and optional `structuredContent` for machine-readable output. (These method names and examples are part of the MCP docs.) ([Model Context Protocol][2])

---

## 6) Transports: local vs remote

* **Local (stdin/stdout)**: useful for desktop apps or tight local integrations (fast, no network).
* **Remote (HTTP + SSE / WebSocket)**: used for cloud-hosted MCP servers, supports streaming updates/events.
  The spec supports both and defines how to negotiate capabilities. ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 7) Tool schema & structured outputs

* Tools publish **JSON Schema** for inputs and structured output shapes. That lets the LLM or client validate/format arguments and parse the results reliably (and enables tooling like UI generators, type-safe clients, and validators). The schema also lets hosts display consent screens that explain what data is requested. ([Model Context Protocol][3])

---

## 8) Who already provides MCP servers (notable available servers & ecosystems)

**A. Official reference implementations & “example” servers**
The MCP project maintains a large repository of reference servers (demonstrations / canonical examples) — e.g., **Fetch**, **Filesystem**, **Git**, **Memory**, **Time**, **Everything** — used to learn and test MCP features. That repo is the canonical index of reference servers. ([GitHub][4])

**B. Major platform adopters / product integrations**

* **Anthropic** — introduced MCP and maintains the spec/references. ([anthropic.com][5])
* **OpenAI** — included MCP support in its Agents tooling / SDK docs (OpenAI Agents references MCP usage). ([OpenAI GitHub][6])
* **Microsoft / Copilot Studio & VS Code** — Copilot Studio and VS Code agent integrations can discover and use MCP servers; Microsoft documentation shows using MCP servers inside Copilot Studio and VS Code. ([Microsoft Learn][7])
* **Figma** — Figma has added MCP server support for its “Make” design/code outputs so agents can access design/code context. (Recent product announcements and press coverage.) ([The Verge][8])
* **Cursor, Replit, Codeium, Sourcegraph** — early adopters/integrations have been announced or noted in coverage and the community (Anthropic cited examples). ([The Verge][9])

**C. Third-party / ecosystem MCP servers & SaaS integrators**
The MCP servers repository also lists many third-party, production-ready servers and vendors who provide MCP servers for enterprise apps (examples: Paragon/ActionKit, Aiven, Algolia, Alation, AgentQL, AgentRPC, AgentOps, Buildable, Buildkite, etc.). These are either turnkey integrations (SaaS that exposes many connectors as MCP tools) or vendor-maintained connectors. See the "Third-Party Servers / Official Integrations" section of the MCP servers repo for a long list. ([GitHub][4])

**D. Community & SDK support**
There are SDKs and helper libraries in many languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, C#, Java, Rust, etc.) and utility projects (FastMCP, FastAPI examples) to make building servers quick — the MCP org and docs list language SDKs and quickstarts. ([GitHub][4])

---

## 9) How people actually use MCP servers (common patterns)

* **IDE/Desktop agents**: local MCP servers expose local files, run builds, or do code actions (VS Code/Copilot-style). ([Visual Studio Code][10])
* **RAG & data access**: expose private knowledge bases as MCP **resources** and enable the model to call search/query tools. ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Action orchestration**: LLMs call tools to send emails, create PRs, run CI pipelines, or interact with SaaS via an MCP server that wraps those APIs. ([GitHub][4])
* **Secure automation**: Hosts present consent screens and only allow actions the user authorized; servers keep audit logs and can implement approval flows. ([Model Context Protocol][1])

---

## 10) Choosing or running an MCP server — practical checklist

When you pick or build an MCP server, evaluate:

* **Security & consent** — does it support per-user authorization and fine-grained scopes? (required) ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Transport needs** — do you need local (stdio) or remote (HTTP/SSE) operation? ([Philschmid][11])
* **Tool schema quality** — are inputs/outputs strongly typed (JSON Schema)? ([Model Context Protocol][3])
* **Auditability** — logging, tool-call history, errors, and who approved a tool call. ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Ecosystem & connectors** — does it include the connectors you need (Git, Slack, DBs, your SaaS)? See the MCP servers registry for available integrators. ([GitHub][4])
* **Multi-tenant / rate limits / cost** — how will you enforce quotas for tenants? (important for SaaS)
* **Testing / sandbox mode** — ability to run servers in a sandbox before granting live actions.

---

## 11) Quick getting-started pointers (hands-on)

* **Try the reference servers repo** to see examples (Fetch, Filesystem, Git). ([GitHub][4])
* **Use FastMCP / language SDKs** to scaffold a server quickly (Python/TypeScript helpers exist). ([Model Context Protocol][12])
* **Connect to an agent client** (e.g., Copilot/VS Code, OpenAI Agents, or a local agent) and test `tools/list` / `tools/call`. See the MCP quickstarts. ([OpenAI GitHub][6])

---

## 12) Where to read / authoritative links

* MCP specification (official): **modelcontextprotocol.io (spec & architecture)**. ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* Official MCP servers & reference implementations (GitHub): **modelcontextprotocol/servers**. ([GitHub][4])
* Anthropic’s announcement/introduction to MCP. ([anthropic.com][5])
* Practical docs / quickstarts (FastMCP, examples). ([Model Context Protocol][12])
* Platform integrations: Microsoft Copilot Studio docs and Figma product news. ([Microsoft Learn][7])

## Want me to…?

* — **Show a tiny working MCP server** you can run locally (I can produce a minimal `FastMCP` or FastAPI-based server example with `tools/list` and `tools/call`)?
* — **Help pick a production MCP server** from the ecosystem for a specific use case (IDE integration, enterprise RAG, SaaS orchestration)?

Tell me which path you want (local demo code vs production selection) and I’ll produce the code or a tailored recommendation next.

Got it ✅ — let’s build a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that your **local agent** can connect to.

The MCP server is like a **tool provider**: it exposes structured tools (email, web search, etc.) that the agent can call during reasoning.

I’ll give you a **minimal MCP server implementation** in Python, using FastAPI as the transport layer.

---

# 🛠 MCP Server Example (Python + FastAPI)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
mcp_server/
 ├─ server.py        # MCP server (exposes tools)
 ├─ tools/
 │   ├─ email_tool.py
 │   ├─ web_tool.py
```

---

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
```

---

## 2. Define Tools

### 📧 Email Tool (`tools/email_tool.py`)

*(Mocked for now — can integrate with SMTP later)*

```python
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    # Mock email sender
    return f"✅ Email sent to {to} with subject '{subject}'"
```

### 🌐 Web Tool (`tools/web_tool.py`)

```python
import requests

def fetch_webpage(url: str) -> str:
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        return resp.text[:500]  # return first 500 chars
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error fetching {url}: {str(e)}"
```

---

## 3. MCP Server (`server.py`)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from tools.email_tool import send_email
from tools.web_tool import fetch_webpage

app = FastAPI(title="MCP Server")

# === Request Schemas ===
class EmailRequest(BaseModel):
    to: str
    subject: str
    body: str

class WebRequest(BaseModel):
    url: str

# === MCP Tool Endpoints ===
@app.post("/tool/email/send")
def mcp_email(req: EmailRequest):
    result = send_email(req.to, req.subject, req.body)
    return {"tool": "email", "result": result}

@app.post("/tool/web/fetch")
def mcp_web(req: WebRequest):
    result = fetch_webpage(req.url)
    return {"tool": "web", "result": result}

# Root check
@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"status": "MCP server running", "tools": ["email", "web"]}
```

---

## 4. Run the MCP Server

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Server available at:
👉 `http://localhost:8000`
Available tools:

* `POST /tool/email/send`
* `POST /tool/web/fetch`

---

## 5. Query MCP from Your Agent

Modify your **local agent** so it can call MCP tools:

```python
import requests

class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url="http://localhost:8000"):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def send_email(self, to, subject, body):
        resp = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/tool/email/send",
                             json={"to": to, "subject": subject, "body": body})
        return resp.json()

    def fetch_web(self, url):
        resp = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/tool/web/fetch", json={"url": url})
        return resp.json()
```

---

## ✅ Example Usage

```python
mcp = MCPClient()

print(mcp.send_email("test@example.com", "Hello!", "This is a test email."))
# → {"tool": "email", "result": "✅ Email sent to test@example.com with subject 'Hello!'"}

print(mcp.fetch_web("https://example.com"))
# → {"tool": "web", "result": "<!doctype html>..."}
```

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Integrate this MCP server with your **local agent** so the agent can call these tools autonomously.
* Add more tools: calendar, database, file storage.
* Secure with **auth keys** if multiple agents will connect.

---

👉 Do you want me to extend this so that your **agent automatically chooses when to call the MCP tools** (using function-calling style with the LLM), or should we keep it as **manual tool invocation** for now?
