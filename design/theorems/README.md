Just like the **CAP Theorem**, there are several other **theoretical models and trade-off frameworks** in distributed systems and architecture that are **not design patterns or principles**, but are **used to guide architectural decisions**.

These are usually **laws**, **theorems**, or **axioms** â€” **constraints** you must consider when designing systems, especially distributed, scalable, or fault-tolerant architectures.

| **Peter Principle (System Scalability)** | Systems fail when scaled without revisiting design                                                                                                                                            | Informally used in system complexity discussions             |

## âœ… Not Design Patterns or Principles Because:

* They **don't prescribe reusable code structures** (like Singleton, Factory).
* They **don't offer general design advice** (like SOLID, KISS).
* They are **constraints or mathematical/logical truths** that you **must respect** when designing systems.
