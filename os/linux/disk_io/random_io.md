Excellent question — this is **fundamental to understanding database and filesystem performance** in Linux (and why systems like Cassandra use SSTables).

Let’s unpack this step-by-step 👇

## 🧠 What Is I/O?

**I/O (Input/Output)** in Linux refers to reading and writing data between **CPU ↔ memory ↔ storage devices (HDD, SSD)**.

The way those reads/writes are *patterned* across the disk defines whether they are **sequential** or **random**.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Sequential I/O

### 📖 Definition:

Sequential I/O means **reading or writing data blocks that are contiguous on disk** — one right after another.

The disk head (on HDD) or flash controller (on SSD) can **stream data in a continuous flow**.

### 💡 Example:

Imagine a file stored contiguously:

```
[Block 1][Block 2][Block 3][Block 4]
```

A sequential read of all 4 blocks reads them **in order**, without jumping around.

### ⚡ Characteristics:

| Property           | Sequential I/O                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Disk head movement | Minimal (linear read/write)                    |
| Throughput         | Very high                                      |
| Latency            | Low                                            |
| Typical operations | Bulk reads, log appends, backups, streaming    |
| Common examples    | Database commit logs, SSTable flush, file copy |

### 📊 Performance:

* **HDDs:** Sequential I/O is *tens of times faster* than random I/O because the disk arm doesn’t need to seek new positions.
* **SSDs:** Still faster for sequential I/O (controller can pipeline better, fewer metadata lookups).

---

## ⚙️ 2. Random I/O

### 📖 Definition:

Random I/O means reading/writing **non-contiguous blocks**, scattered across the disk.

### 💡 Example:

A process reads blocks in this order:

```
[Block 4], [Block 20], [Block 3], [Block 17]
```

Each request may cause the disk head (on HDD) or controller (on SSD) to **jump to a different location**.

### ⚡ Characteristics:

| Property           | Random I/O                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disk head movement | High (frequent seeks)                                                |
| Throughput         | Lower                                                                |
| Latency            | Higher                                                               |
| Typical operations | Database queries, key-value lookups, index updates                   |
| Common examples    | Reading many small records from B-trees, updating random rows in SQL |

### 📊 Performance:

* **HDDs:** Very slow due to seek + rotational latency (~10ms per seek).
* **SSDs:** Faster (no seek head), but still slower than sequential because of:

  * Flash page alignment issues
  * FTL (Flash Translation Layer) mapping overhead

| Access pattern     | Contiguous blocks       | Scattered blocks             |

## 💽 Linux View: Buffers and I/O Scheduler

In Linux, I/O passes through several layers:

```
User Space → VFS → Page Cache → Block Layer → Device Driver → Disk
```

The **block layer** uses an **I/O scheduler** (`cfq`, `deadline`, `noop`, `mq-deadline`, `bfq`, etc.)
These schedulers try to **reorder random I/O** into **sequential** batches for better throughput.

You can check the scheduler for a disk:

```bash
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

Or measure random/sequential performance with `fio`:

```bash
fio --name=seqwrite --rw=write --bs=1M --size=1G --numjobs=1
fio --name=randread --rw=randread --bs=4k --size=1G --numjobs=1
```

## 🧱 Database Perspective

| Storage Engine                     | I/O Strategy                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL / MySQL (B-Tree)**    | Random I/O (updates in-place)                  |
| **Cassandra / RocksDB (LSM Tree)** | Sequential I/O (append-only, compaction later) |

That’s why **SSTables + commit logs** give huge performance gains — they **convert random writes into sequential writes**.

Would you like me to also explain **how Linux converts random writes into sequential writes internally (using page cache, journaling, and I/O schedulers)**?
