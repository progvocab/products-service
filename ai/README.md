### Supervised 
works with Labelled Data
- [Classification](machine_learning/classifier/)
- [Regression](machine_learning/Regression)

###  Foundation Models 

* A **foundation model** is a large pre-trained model that learns general knowledge from massive data and can be adapted to many tasks.

### Multi Model 


* A **multimodal model** is a model that can process and relate multiple data types (text, image, audio, video).
* A foundation model can be unimodal or multimodal; multimodality is a **capability**, not a category.
