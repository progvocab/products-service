Sure — let’s break down the **Diffie–Hellman algorithm** in simple, clear steps 👇

---

## 🌐 What It Is

**Diffie–Hellman (DH)** is a **key exchange algorithm**.
It allows two people (say, Alice and Bob) to **securely share a secret key over an insecure channel** — even if someone is listening.

That shared secret key can later be used for **encryption** (e.g. in AES) or **authentication**.

---

## 🔑 The Main Idea

Instead of sending the secret key directly (which could be intercepted),
both sides exchange *numbers* in such a way that **only they** can compute the final shared key.

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Process

Let’s assume:

* ( p ): a large prime number (public)
* ( g ): a primitive root modulo ( p ) (also public)

Both ( p ) and ( g ) can be known by everyone — even an attacker.

---

### 1️⃣ Alice and Bob agree on ( p ) and ( g )

These are *public parameters*.

Example:
( p = 23 ), ( g = 5 )

---

### 2️⃣ Each picks a **private key**

* Alice picks a secret ( a )
* Bob picks a secret ( b )

Example:
( a = 6 ), ( b = 15 )

---

### 3️⃣ Each computes a **public key**

Using the formula:
[
A = g^a \bmod p
]
[
B = g^b \bmod p
]

Example:
( A = 5^6 \bmod 23 = 8 )
( B = 5^{15} \bmod 23 = 19 )

Alice sends ( A ) to Bob, Bob sends ( B ) to Alice.

Even if someone sees ( A ) and ( B ), they can’t easily find ( a ) or ( b ) — because that requires solving the **discrete logarithm problem**, which is computationally hard.

---

### 4️⃣ Each computes the **shared secret**

Now, both can compute the same key:

For Alice:
[
S = B^a \bmod p
]
For Bob:
[
S = A^b \bmod p
]

Example:
Alice computes ( S = 19^6 \bmod 23 = 2 )
Bob computes ( S = 8^{15} \bmod 23 = 2 )

✅ Both get the same secret: ( S = 2 )

That number (or a hash of it) becomes their **shared encryption key**.

---

## 🔐 Why It’s Secure

* The security relies on the **difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem**:
  Given ( g ), ( p ), and ( g^a \bmod p ), it’s extremely hard to find ( a ) if ( p ) is large enough.
* Even if an eavesdropper sees ( g ), ( p ), ( A ), and ( B ), they can’t feasibly compute ( S ).
