Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs visualize the **key generation process in TLS 1.3** at a **low-level**, focusing specifically on the **ECDHE key exchange** (using an elliptic curve like `x25519` or `secp256r1`).

Below is a **Mermaid sequence diagram** that shows step-by-step how the client and server generate and derive the **shared session key** from ephemeral keys.

    Note over Client,Server: üîê TLS 1.3 - Ephemeral ECDHE Key Generation Process

    %% === STEP 1: CLIENT KEY GENERATION ===
    Client->>Client: Generate random private key (a)
    Client->>Client: Compute public key A = a * G (G = generator point)
    Client->>Server: Send "ClientHello" + KeyShare(A, curve = x25519)

    %% === STEP 2: SERVER KEY GENERATION ===
    Server->>Server: Generate random private key (b)
    Server->>Server: Compute public key B = b * G
    Server->>Client: Send "ServerHello" + KeyShare(B, curve = x25519)

    %% === STEP 3: SHARED SECRET DERIVATION ===
    Note over Client,Server: Both sides now compute shared secret using ECDHE

    Client->>Client: Compute shared_secret = a * B
    Server->>Server: Compute shared_secret = b * A
    Note over Client,Server: shared_secret = a * b * G  (identical on both sides)

    %% === STEP 4: KEY SCHEDULE USING HKDF ===
    Note over Client,Server: Apply HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)

    Client->>Client: Derive early_secret = HKDF-Extract(0, PSK or 0)
    Client->>Client: Derive handshake_secret = HKDF-Extract(early_secret, shared_secret)
    Client->>Client: Derive master_secret = HKDF-Extract(handshake_secret, 0)

    Server->>Server: Same derivation using shared_secret

    %% === STEP 5: FINAL KEY MATERIAL ===
    Note over Client,Server: Both now have identical keys:
    Note over Client,Server:
      - handshake_traffic_keys (for handshake encryption)
      - application_traffic_keys (for data encryption)
      - finished_key (for verifying handshake integrity)

    Client->>Server: Send "Finished" (MAC over handshake)
    Server->>Client: Send "Finished" (MAC over handshake)
    Note over Client,Server: üîë Secure communication begins

### üß© Breakdown of What‚Äôs Happening

| Stage                            | Description                                                                                           | Result                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Key Generation**            | Each side generates a random private scalar and computes a public point on the chosen elliptic curve. | `(a, A)` for client and `(b, B)` for server |
| **2. Key Exchange**              | Public keys are exchanged in `ClientHello` and `ServerHello`.                                         | Both know `A` and `B`                       |
| **3. Shared Secret Computation** | Each side multiplies its private key with the other‚Äôs public key.                                     | Shared secret = `a * b * G`                 |
| **4. HKDF Key Derivation**       | The shared secret is fed into **HKDF-Extract/Expand** functions to derive handshake and session keys. | `handshake_secret`, `master_secret`         |
| **5. Traffic Keys Ready**        | Final symmetric keys used for encryption and authentication are derived.                              | Secure TLS channel established              |

Would you like me to extend this diagram to show **the exact HKDF-Extract and Expand stages** (e.g., how early_secret ‚Üí handshake_secret ‚Üí master_secret ‚Üí traffic keys are chained)? That gives a truly **cryptographic-level view** of the TLS 1.3 key schedule.


Excellent question ‚Äî this goes right into the **core of TLS (Transport Layer Security)** key exchange and how **AES-GCM** (used for encryption) is set up securely between the browser (client) and the web server.

Let‚Äôs walk through it step by step ‚Äî clearly and precisely üëá

---

## üß† 1. Context

When your browser connects to a secure site (`https://`), TLS is used to:

* **Authenticate** the server (and optionally client),
* **Agree** on a shared symmetric key,
* **Encrypt** data (using AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, etc.),
* **Ensure integrity** of the communication.

---

## üîê 2. Key Exchange Goal

Both the client (browser) and server must **derive the same shared secret key** ‚Äî but in such a way that:

* No one observing the network can compute it.
* Even if the long-term private key is compromised later, past sessions stay secure (‚Üí **forward secrecy**).

That‚Äôs done using **Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman** (ECDHE).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. TLS 1.3 Handshake (simplified with AES-GCM)

Below is the high-level flow when AES-GCM (say AES-128-GCM) is negotiated:

| Step | Message                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **ClientHello**                  | The browser sends supported cipher suites (e.g., `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`), random nonce (`client_random`), and its ephemeral public key (**EC public key**).                            |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **ServerHello**                  | The server picks a cipher suite (AES-GCM), sends its random nonce (`server_random`), and its own ephemeral public key.                                                                   |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Shared Secret Computation**    | Both client and server use their **private ephemeral keys** and the other‚Äôs public key to compute a **shared secret** using ECDHE.                                                       |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | **Key Derivation (HKDF)**        | The shared secret + both random values are passed through **HKDF** (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) to produce symmetric keys: - AES-GCM encryption key - Nonce base - Integrity key |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | **Server Authentication**        | The server sends its **certificate** (for identity verification). The client verifies this using CA chain.                                                                               |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  | **Finished Messages**            | Both sides exchange ‚ÄúFinished‚Äù messages encrypted with the new keys, proving they computed the same session key.                                                                         |
| ‚úÖ    | **Application Data (Encrypted)** | Now both browser and server encrypt/decrypt all traffic using AES-GCM and derived nonces.                                                                                                |

## üß© 4. AES-GCM: Key & Nonce Details

Once the handshake completes:

| Parameter      | Who Derives It                     | How                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AES Key**    | Both                               | From HKDF output using shared secret + handshake transcript |
| **Nonce (IV)** | Both                               | Derived deterministically from HKDF + per-record counter    |
| **GCM Tag**    | Automatically generated by AES-GCM | Ensures data integrity                                      |

**AES-GCM** requires:

* A **128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit key**
* A **96-bit nonce (IV)**
  TLS ensures both are generated deterministically and identically on both sides.

## üßÆ 5. Summary of What‚Äôs Exchanged

| Item                            | Exchanged over network | Derived (never sent) |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Client ephemeral public key     | ‚úÖ Sent                 |                      |
| Server ephemeral public key     | ‚úÖ Sent                 |                      |
| Long-term server certificate    | ‚úÖ Sent                 |                      |
| Shared secret (ECDHE result)    | ‚ùå Derived              |                      |
| AES key                         | ‚ùå Derived              |                      |
| AES-GCM Nonce                   | ‚ùå Derived              |                      |
| Session ticket (for resumption) | ‚úÖ Sent after handshake |                      |

## üß∞ 6. Example Cipher Suite

`TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`

* `AES_128_GCM` ‚Üí symmetric encryption and integrity (AEAD)
* `SHA256` ‚Üí used inside HKDF for key derivation
* Key exchange ‚Üí `ECDHE`
* Authentication ‚Üí via server‚Äôs certificate (RSA or ECDSA)

---

## üßæ 7. Key Takeaway

üëâ The **client and server never send the AES key or nonce directly**.
Instead, both **derive them locally** from the **ECDHE shared secret** using **HKDF** and random values exchanged during the handshake.

This ensures:

* **Confidentiality** (no one else knows the key)
* **Integrity** (AES-GCM provides authentication tag)
* **Forward secrecy** (keys are temporary)

---

Would you like me to illustrate this with a **diagram of the TLS 1.3 key exchange**, showing exactly what flows over the wire and what‚Äôs derived internally?
