Here are some LeetCode problems / tags that are related to **set theory** (sets, intersections, unions, uniqueness, etc.). Some are more directly about set operations; others use set‚Äêideas (uniqueness, counting distinct, etc.).

## üîç Sample LeetCode Problems Involving Set Theory / Set Concepts

| Problem                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subsets**                            | Return all possible subsets (power set) of a given set of unique numbers. ([leetcode.com][1])                                                                              |
| **Subsets II**                         | Return all subsets of an array that *may* contain duplicates, without duplicate subsets in the output. ([leetcode.com][2])                                                 |
| **Intersection of Two Arrays**         | Given two arrays, return their intersection with *unique* elements. ([leetcode.com][3])                                                                                    |
| **Set Mismatch**                       | Given an array of numbers 1...n with one number duplicated and one missing, find the duplicated & missing. Involves treating what should be a set. ([leetcode.com][4])     |
| **Set Intersection Size At Least Two** | Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum size of a set such that each interval has at least two elements from that set. ([leetcode.com][5])                       |
| **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**    | Grouping / partitioning elements into disjoint sets, performing unions, checking connectivity etc. LeetCode has a number of DSU / Union-Find problems. ([leetcode.com][6]) |
