### 🌳 What Is a **Suffix Tree**?

A **Suffix Tree** is a **compressed trie** (prefix tree) containing **all suffixes** of a given string. It's a powerful data structure used for fast **pattern matching**, **substring search**, **longest repeated substring**, and more.

---

### 📚 Definition

A **suffix tree** for a string `S` of length `n` is a rooted directed tree with the following properties:

1. Each edge is labeled with a **non-empty substring** of `S`.
2. No two edges starting from the same node can begin with the **same character**.
3. Every suffix of `S` is represented by a **path from the root to a leaf**.
4. The tree is **compressed** — repeated sequences are merged.

> Typically, we append a special character `$` (not in the alphabet) to `S` to make all suffixes unique.

---

### 🔍 Example

For string `S = "banana$"`, the suffixes are:

* `"banana$"`
* `"anana$"`
* `"nana$"`
* `"ana$"`
* `"na$"`
* `"a$"`
* `"$"`

The **suffix tree** stores all these efficiently in a compressed form.

### 🧠 Why Use a Suffix Tree?

| Problem                                  | Time Complexity |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Check if substring exists in `O(m)`      | `O(m)`          |
| Count number of occurrences of a pattern | `O(m)`          |
| Find longest repeated substring          | `O(n)`          |
| Longest common substring between strings | `O(n + m)`      |

---

### 🚀 Applications

* **String matching** in linear time
* **Genome sequencing**
* **Data compression**
* **Plagiarism detection**
* **Spell checking / Auto-completion**

---

### 🛠️ Construction

* **Naïve Method**: `O(n²)` — insert all suffixes one by one.
* **Ukkonen’s Algorithm**: `O(n)` — optimal suffix tree construction.

### ⚙️ Python (Basic Naive Suffix Tree — for Education)

Here’s a simple (non-optimized) suffix tree using a trie-like approach:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}

class SuffixTree:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.root = Node()
        self.build(text)

    def build(self, text):
        text += '$'  # Ensure uniqueness
        for i in range(len(text)):
            current = self.root
            for char in text[i:]:
                if char not in current.children:
                    current.children[char] = Node()
                current = current.children[char]

    def search(self, pattern):
        current = self.root
        for char in pattern:
            if char not in current.children:
                return False
            current = current.children[char]
        return True

# Example
tree = SuffixTree("banana")
print(tree.search("ana"))  # True
print(tree.search("nana")) # True
print(tree.search("apple")) # False
```

---

### ⚠️ Limitations

* The naive version takes `O(n²)` time and space.
* For serious usage, use **Ukkonen's algorithm** or libraries like:

  * `pysuffix` (for Python)
  * `STree` (third-party C++/Java implementations)
