 let’s go step by step on **K-Means** in the context of **unsupervised learning**.

---

## 🔹 What is K-Means?

**K-Means** is a **clustering algorithm** used in **unsupervised learning**.
It partitions a dataset into **K clusters** where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest **centroid** (mean of points in that cluster).

It’s “unsupervised” because:

* We don’t provide labels.
* The algorithm finds hidden groupings based only on feature similarity.

---

## 🔹 How K-Means Works (Algorithm Steps)

1. **Choose K** (the number of clusters).
2. **Initialize centroids** randomly (pick K random points).
3. **Assign step**: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid (using Euclidean or Manhattan distance).
4. **Update step**: Recompute centroids as the **mean of all points** in each cluster.
5. **Repeat steps 3–4** until:

   * Centroids stop changing significantly (convergence), or
   * Max iterations reached.

## 🔹 Formula

* Distance measure (usually Euclidean):

  $$
  d(x, c) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - c_i)^2}
  $$

* Objective function (inertia / within-cluster sum of squares):

  $$
  J = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{x \in C_k} \|x - \mu_k\|^2
  $$

  where $\mu_k$ = centroid of cluster $C_k$.

Goal = minimize $J$.

## 🔹 Use Cases of K-Means

* **Customer segmentation** (grouping customers by buying patterns).
* **Image compression** (cluster colors → reduce palette).
* **Document clustering** (topic grouping).
* **Anomaly detection** (small clusters = outliers).
* **Recommender systems** (group similar users/items).

## 🔹 Simple Python Example

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample 2D data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
              [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Apply KMeans with 2 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0, n_init=10).fit(X)

print("Cluster Centers:", kmeans.cluster_centers_)
print("Labels:", kmeans.labels_)

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1],
            c='red', marker='X', s=200)
plt.show()
```

## 🔹 Advantages

* Simple and fast.
* Works well on large datasets.
* Easy to interpret clusters.

## 🔹 Limitations

* Must predefine **K** (not always obvious).
* Sensitive to initialization (can get stuck in local minima).
* Assumes clusters are spherical and similar size.
* Struggles with non-convex shapes or varying density.

✅ **Summary:**
K-Means is an **unsupervised clustering algorithm** that partitions data into **K groups** by minimizing distances to cluster centroids. It’s widely used for segmentation, compression, and exploratory analysis.
