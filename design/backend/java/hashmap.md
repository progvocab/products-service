### Hashmap internal working 

A HashMap stores key-value pairs using an array of buckets (bins) where each bucket can hold a linked list of nodes. When a key is added, its hashCode() method is used to calculate an index (bucket). If multiple keys hash to the same index (collision), they are stored in a linked list at that bucket. When retrieving a value, the process is reversed: the key's hashCode() is used to find the bucket, and then the equals() method is used to compare keys within that bucket. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Elaboration: [1, 2]  

 - Buckets/Bins: A HashMap uses an array of buckets, also known as bins, to store data. Each bucket can potentially hold multiple key-value pairs. [1, 2, 3]  
 - Nodes: Each key-value pair is stored in a Node object. These nodes are linked together within a bucket to handle potential collisions (two or more keys hashing to the same index). [1, 3, 4, 6]  
 - Hashing: The hashCode() method of the key is used to calculate an index (bucket) within the array. This index determines where the key-value pair will be stored. [3, 4]  
 - Collision Handling: If two keys have the same hashcode, they will be stored in the same bucket (collision). To resolve this, Java uses chaining, where a linked list is used to store multiple key-value pairs within the same bucket. [1, 4]  
 - Put Operation: When a key-value pair is added (put), the key's hashCode() is calculated to determine the bucket. If the bucket is empty, the new node is placed there. If the bucket is not empty (collision), the new node is added to the linked list in that bucket. [1, 3, 4]  
 - Get Operation: When a value is retrieved (get), the key's hashCode() is calculated to find the bucket. The equals() method is then used to compare the key with the keys stored in the linked list of that bucket to find the matching value. [3, 5]  
- Java 8 and beyond: In Java 8 and later, HashMap uses a combination of linked lists and red-black trees to handle collisions. When the number of nodes in a bucket exceeds a threshold, the linked list is converted to a red-black tree for better performance. [7]
