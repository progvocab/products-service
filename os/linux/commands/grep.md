Yes âœ…, in many cases you donâ€™t even need `find` â€” you can use **`grep` directly** to search through log files.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Search in All Files of Current Directory

```bash
grep "ERROR" *.log
```

* Looks for `"ERROR"` in all `.log` files in the current directory.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Recursive Search in All Subdirectories

```bash
grep -r "ERROR" .
```

* `-r` â†’ recursive (searches all files under `.`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Show Line Numbers

```bash
grep -rn "ERROR" .
```

* `-n` â†’ show line number.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Case-Insensitive Search

```bash
grep -ri "error" .
```

* `-i` â†’ ignore case (`error`, `ERROR`, `Error`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Show Only Filenames (not the actual matches)

```bash
grep -rl "Exception" .
```

* `-l` â†’ list only files containing the text.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Count Matches

```bash
grep -rc "ERROR" .
```

* `-c` â†’ count number of matching lines per file.

---

âœ… **When to use `find` vs `grep`?**

* Use **`grep -r`** if you just want to search through *all files*.
* Use **`find` + `grep`** if you need extra filtering, like:

  * Only search `.log` files
  * Only search files > 1 MB
  * Only search files modified in last 2 days

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to give you a **one-liner command that finds only log files modified in the last 24 hours and greps for ERROR**?
