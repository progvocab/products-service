about **LeetCode 2471 — Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level**.
This is a **great problem** that mixes **binary trees + BFS level traversal + minimum swaps (cycle decomposition)**. Let’s go step by step.

---

## Problem Restatement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree.
At each level of the tree, you can rearrange the node values in **any order**, but you want to minimize the **number of swaps** to make the level sorted in ascending order.

Return the **minimum total number of swaps** needed across all levels.

---

## Key Insights

1. **Traverse level by level** (BFS).
2. At each level, collect all node values.
3. To sort a list with the **minimum swaps**, we can use the **cycle decomposition method** (like in your previous question).

   * For a cycle of length `k`, swaps needed = `k - 1`.
4. Add up swaps for each level.

## Step-by-Step Example

Tree:

```
        1
       / \
      4   3
     / \
    7   6
```

* Level 0: `[1]` → already sorted → 0 swaps
* Level 1: `[4, 3]` → sorted: `[3, 4]` → needs 1 swap
* Level 2: `[7, 6]` → sorted: `[6, 7]` → needs 1 swap

✅ Answer = `0 + 1 + 1 = 2`

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, root):
        def min_swaps_to_sort(arr):
            n = len(arr)
            arrpos = sorted([(val, i) for i, val in enumerate(arr)])
            visited = [False] * n
            swaps = 0

            for i in range(n):
                if visited[i] or arrpos[i][1] == i:
                    continue

                cycle_size = 0
                j = i
                while not visited[j]:
                    visited[j] = True
                    j = arrpos[j][1]
                    cycle_size += 1

                if cycle_size > 1:
                    swaps += cycle_size - 1
            return swaps

        # BFS level order traversal
        q = deque([root])
        total_swaps = 0

        while q:
            level = []
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                level.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            total_swaps += min_swaps_to_sort(level)

        return total_swaps
```

---

## Complexity

* BFS traversal: **O(N)**
* For each level, min swaps calculation: **O(M log M)** (sorting), where M = size of that level
* Overall: **O(N log N)** worst case.

✅ This is the **optimized solution** used in contests.

Would you like me to **dry run the code** on a custom tree with detailed swap cycles for each level, so you see exactly how swaps are counted?
