In **Apache Maven**, a build automation and project management tool, the **build lifecycle** is a well-defined sequence of phases that dictate how a project is built, tested, and deployed. Each phase represents a stage in the build process, and Maven executes these phases in a specific order to complete the build. Below is an explanation of the **default lifecycle phases** in Maven, along with their purposes:

---

### **Maven Lifecycle Overview**
Maven has three built-in lifecycles:
1. **Default Lifecycle**: Handles project deployment.
2. **Clean Lifecycle**: Handles project cleaning.
3. **Site Lifecycle**: Handles project documentation.

The **Default Lifecycle** is the most commonly used and includes the following phases:

### **Default Lifecycle Phases**
Here are the key phases in the **Default Lifecycle**, listed in the order they are executed:

1. **validate**:
   - Validates that the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
   - Ensures the project structure and dependencies are valid.

2. **initialize**:
   - Initializes the build state (e.g., setting properties or creating directories).

3. **generate-sources**:
   - Generates any source code needed for the build (e.g., from annotations or templates).

4. **process-sources**:
   - Processes the source code (e.g., filtering or transforming files).

5. **generate-resources**:
   - Generates resources (e.g., configuration files) for inclusion in the package.

6. **process-resources**:
   - Processes and copies resources into the destination directory (e.g., `target/classes`).

7. **compile**:
   - Compiles the project's source code into the target directory (e.g., `target/classes`).

8. **process-classes**:
   - Post-processes compiled classes (e.g., bytecode enhancement).

9. **generate-test-sources**:
   - Generates any test source code needed for the build.

10. **process-test-sources**:
    - Processes the test source code.

11. **generate-test-resources**:
    - Generates resources for testing.

12. **process-test-resources**:
    - Processes and copies test resources into the test destination directory.

13. **test-compile**:
    - Compiles the test source code into the test destination directory.

14. **process-test-classes**:
    - Post-processes compiled test classes.

15. **test**:
    - Runs unit tests using a suitable testing framework (e.g., JUnit).

16. **prepare-package**:
    - Performs any operations needed to prepare the package before packaging.

17. **package**:
    - Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR, EAR).

18. **pre-integration-test**:
    - Performs actions required before integration tests (e.g., starting a server).

19. **integration-test**:
    - Processes and deploys the package into an environment where integration tests can be run.

20. **post-integration-test**:
    - Performs actions required after integration tests (e.g., stopping a server).

21. **verify**:
    - Runs checks to verify that the package is valid and meets quality criteria.

22. **install**:
    - Installs the package into the local Maven repository for use as a dependency in other projects.

23. **deploy**:
    - Copies the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers or projects.

### **Clean Lifecycle Phases**
The **Clean Lifecycle** is used to clean up the project's build artifacts. It has three phases:
1. **pre-clean**: Executes processes needed before cleaning.
2. **clean**: Removes files generated during the build (e.g., the `target` directory).
3. **post-clean**: Executes processes needed after cleaning.

---

### **Site Lifecycle Phases**
The **Site Lifecycle** is used to generate project documentation and reports. It has four phases:
1. **pre-site**: Executes processes needed before generating the site.
2. **site**: Generates the project's site documentation.
3. **post-site**: Executes processes needed after generating the site.
4. **site-deploy**: Deploys the generated site documentation to a server.

---

### **How Maven Executes Phases**
- Maven executes phases in a specific order. For example, if you run:
  ```bash
  mvn install
  ```
  Maven will execute all phases up to and including `install` (i.e., `validate`, `compile`, `test`, `package`, etc.).
- You can also run a specific phase directly. For example:
  ```bash
  mvn compile
  ```
  This will execute all phases up to and including `compile`.

### **Common Maven Commands**
| Command                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mvn clean`                 | Cleans the project by deleting the `target` directory.                      |
| `mvn compile`               | Compiles the project's source code.                                         |
| `mvn test`                  | Compiles and runs unit tests.                                               |
| `mvn package`               | Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).    |
| `mvn install`               | Installs the package into the local Maven repository.                       |
| `mvn deploy`                | Deploys the package to a remote repository.                                 |
| `mvn site`                  | Generates project documentation.                                            |

### **Summary**
- The **Default Lifecycle** is the most commonly used and includes phases like `compile`, `test`, `package`, `install`, and `deploy`.
- The **Clean Lifecycle** is used to clean up build artifacts.
- The **Site Lifecycle** is used to generate project documentation.
- Maven executes phases in a specific order, and you can trigger a build up to a specific phase.
