 These two problems often confuse people because both involve "water + bars", but the **goal, constraints, and approach differ**.

# üîπ 1. **Trapping Rain Water (LeetCode 42)**

**Problem**:

* Given an array of bar heights, compute how much water is trapped **between the bars** after rain.

**Key Idea**:

* Each index `i` can hold water =
  $\text{min(max_left, max_right)} - \text{height[i]}$
* Uses **two-pointer technique** or precomputed `left_max` & `right_max`.

**Example**:

```
Heights = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Trapped water = 6
```

**Python**:

```python
def trap(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max = right_max = 0
    water = 0
    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                water += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                water += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1
    return water
```

# üîπ 2. **Container With Most Water (LeetCode 11)**

**Problem**:

* Given an array of bar heights, choose **two bars** that form a container with the **maximum area** (height √ó width).
* Here, water doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfill in gaps‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs just between **two chosen walls**.

**Key Idea**:

* Use **two pointers** from both ends.
* Compute area = $\text{min(height[left], height[right]) √ó (right-left)}$.
* Move pointer at shorter bar inward.

**Example**:

```
Heights = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Max water = 49  (between heights 8 and 7 at distance 7)
```

**Python**:

```python
def max_area(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0
    while left < right:
        area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return max_area
```

‚úÖ **Summary**:

* **Trapping Rain Water** = sum of water in valleys (all bars matter).
* **Container With Most Water** = best pair of bars forming largest container.

Would you like me to also give you a **visual ASCII diagram** showing both side by side (to see why one fills valleys while the other just picks 2 walls)?
