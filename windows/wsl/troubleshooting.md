To SSH into your WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instance from your MacBook Air, you need to ensure the following are configured correctly. Here's a step-by-step troubleshooting guide to help identify and fix the root cause:

---

### **1. Get WSL IP Address**

WSL doesn't bind directly to your Windows IP. Instead, it uses a virtual network interface. Run this in WSL:

```bash
ip addr | grep inet
```

Or:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Note down the IP (e.g., `172.x.x.x`).

---

### **2. Install & Start OpenSSH Server in WSL**

Make sure the SSH server is installed and running in your WSL instance:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo service ssh start
```

You may also check status:

```bash
sudo service ssh status
```

Ensure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` allows password login or key login.

---

### **3. Allow Port 22 in Windows Firewall**

You need to open port 22 on Windows:

- Go to **Windows Defender Firewall** > **Advanced Settings**
- Add **Inbound Rule**:
  - **Port:** 22
  - **Allow the connection**
  - **Public/Private**
  - **Name:** `WSL SSH`

---

### **4. Forward Port from Windows to WSL**

Windows doesn’t route traffic to WSL by default. You can use `netsh` to forward traffic from Windows port 2222 to WSL’s port 22:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=22 connectaddress=<WSL-IP>
```

Example:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=22 connectaddress=172.28.28.131
```

Also allow port `2222` through Windows Firewall.

---

### **5. SSH From Mac**

Now from your Mac, connect using:

```bash
ssh <wsl-username>@<windows-ip> -p 2222
```

You can get the Windows IP via `ipconfig` on CMD or PowerShell.

---

### **6. Check Common Issues**

- **SSH not starting:** Check logs in WSL: `sudo journalctl -u ssh` or `sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log`
- **Firewall blocking:** Temporarily disable firewall to test.
- **Wrong port/IP:** Ensure you are connecting to Windows IP on port 2222 (or 22 if directly mapped).
- **Key authentication fails:** Ensure your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is set correctly with the right permissions.

Would you like a script to auto-start and configure port forwarding each time WSL boots?
