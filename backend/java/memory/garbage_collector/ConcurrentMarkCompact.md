Great question 👍 — this goes deep into JVM garbage collectors. Let’s break it down:

---

# 🔹 1. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) GC

* **Type:** Low-latency collector (introduced before G1).

* **Target:** Reduce pause times (good for responsive applications like web servers).

* **How it works:**

  1. **Initial Mark (Stop-the-world):** Marks GC roots (short pause).
  2. **Concurrent Mark:** Traces live objects in parallel with application threads.
  3. **Remark (Stop-the-world):** Completes marking missed objects (short pause).
  4. **Concurrent Sweep:** Sweeps dead objects concurrently (returns free memory).

* **Key Property:**

  * **Does not compact** the heap. Instead, it leaves gaps → leads to **fragmentation** over time.
  * When fragmentation is bad, CMS may fall back to **Full GC (single-threaded, stop-the-world, compacting)** which is very costly.

---

# 🔹 2. Concurrent Mark-Compact (CMC) GC

* Sometimes referred to as **Concurrent Mark-Compact in research/HotSpot experiments**, but in **HotSpot** (Oracle/OpenJDK), the **CMS collector is “Concurrent Mark-Sweep” only** (no compaction).
* The **Parallel Old GC** and later **G1 GC** introduced **concurrent compaction** mechanisms.
* In effect:

  * CMS = concurrent sweep (no compaction).
  * G1 = concurrent marking + **incremental compaction** (partition-based).
  * So, when people say *Concurrent Mark-Compact*, they usually mean a **compacting version of CMS**, but in practice, G1 has replaced it.

# 🔹 3. Which one is better?

| Feature                   | CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)                            | CMC (Compacting GC like G1/Parallel Old)                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pause time**            | Low pause (good for latency-sensitive apps)            | Slightly longer pauses (due to compaction)               |
| **Throughput**            | Lower (due to concurrent background work stealing CPU) | Higher (fewer concurrent phases, better CPU utilization) |
| **Memory fragmentation**  | Yes (needs Full GC eventually)                         | No (compaction avoids fragmentation)                     |
| **Predictability**        | Less predictable (pauses when fragmentation occurs)    | More predictable (compaction keeps memory continuous)    |
| **Modern JVMs (Java 9+)** | Deprecated                                             | G1 (default since Java 9)                                |

# 🔑 Summary

* **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep):**

  * Great for **low-latency apps**.
  * But suffers from **fragmentation** and **Full GC stop-the-world** issues.
  * Deprecated in **Java 9** and removed in **Java 14**.

* **CMC (Mark-Compact, like G1):**

  * Handles **fragmentation** better (compaction).
  * Slightly longer pauses but **better throughput & predictability**.
  * **G1 GC is the modern replacement** → combines concurrent marking with **incremental compaction in regions**.

---

👉 So, **G1 (Concurrent Mark-Compact in spirit)** is better than **CMS** in modern Java.
CMS is obsolete and not recommended anymore.

Would you like me to draw a **Mermaid diagram comparing CMS vs G1 (concurrent mark-compact)** phases step by step, so you can visualize how they differ?
Perfect 👍 Let’s visualize the **difference between CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)** and **G1 (Concurrent Mark-Compact style)** step by step with **Mermaid diagrams**.

---

# 🔹 CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Mark<br>(STW)] --> B[Concurrent Mark<br>(with app running)]
    B --> C[Remark<br>(STW, catch missed refs)]
    C --> D[Concurrent Sweep<br>(reclaim dead objects)]
    D --> E{Heap Fragmented?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Full GC<br>(STW, Compaction)]
    E -->|No| B
```

✅ Low pauses most of the time.
⚠️ Leaves fragmentation → sometimes must run **Full GC** (long STW pause).

---

# 🔹 G1 (Concurrent Mark-Compact style)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Initial Mark<br>(STW, mark roots)] --> B[Concurrent Mark<br>(mark reachable objects)]
    B --> C[Remark<br>(STW, finalize marking)]
    C --> D[Cleanup Phase<br>(identify empty regions)]
    D --> E[Concurrent Copy/Compact<br>(evacuate live objects to new regions)]
    E --> A
```

✅ Breaks heap into **regions**, moves live objects concurrently.
✅ Avoids fragmentation by **compacting incrementally**.
✅ More predictable pauses than CMS.

# 🔑 Key Difference

| Feature    | CMS                                                 | G1 (Mark-Compact style)           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Compaction | ❌ No (leads to fragmentation)                       | ✅ Yes (region-based, incremental) |
| STW Pauses | Very short, but **unpredictable Full GC** may occur | Shorter & **predictable**         |
| Status     | Deprecated, removed in Java 14                      | Default GC since Java 9           |

👉 Would you like me to also show a **memory layout diagram (heap view)** showing how **CMS leaves holes (fragmentation)** while **G1 compacts into regions**?
