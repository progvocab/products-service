let’s place **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** in the right category of ML models.

# 📌 What is KNN?

* **KNN = k-Nearest Neighbors**
* A **non-parametric, instance-based (lazy)** learning algorithm.
* It predicts an output for a new data point based on the labels/values of its **k closest neighbors** (using distance metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.).

---

# 🧠 Which Class of Model?

### ✅ KNN is a **Supervised Learning model**

Because:

* It requires **labeled training data** (features + labels).
* It predicts output for unseen data using the training labels.

---

# 🔀 Tasks KNN Can Do

* **Classification** (most common)

  * Predicts the **class** of a data point based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
  * Example: Handwritten digit recognition (KNN classifies an image as "3" if most nearest neighbors are labeled "3").

* **Regression**

  * Predicts a **continuous value** (e.g., house price) by averaging the values of neighbors.

# 🗂️ Summary Table

| Category          | Where KNN Fits                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Learning Type** | Supervised Learning                         |
| **Model Type**    | Lazy / Instance-Based                       |
| **Typical Task**  | Classification (but can do regression too)  |
| **Not**           | Unsupervised, Generative, Anomaly Detection |

✅ **Answer:**
KNN comes under **Supervised Learning** — usually used as a **classification model**, but it can also be used for **regression**.

Do you want me to also compare **KNN vs Random Forest vs Logistic Regression** (since all are supervised but work very differently)?
