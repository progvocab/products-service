Yes, it **does make sense**—but let’s carefully unpack this.

A **loss function** is the core metric your model tries to optimize during training. Choosing the right loss function is crucial for improving model accuracy, but “accuracy” itself depends on the type of task and recommendation system you are building.

Here are the key points:

---

### 1. Type of Recommendation Task

* **Explicit feedback** (users rate content with scores, e.g., 1–5 stars):

  * You can frame this as a **regression problem**.
  * Common loss functions:

    * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
* **Implicit feedback** (users click, watch, or interact; no rating):

  * Typically a **classification problem** (did the user interact or not).
  * Common loss functions:

    * **Binary Cross-Entropy**
    * **BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) loss** for ranking tasks
    * **Hinge loss** for pairwise ranking

---

### 2. Accuracy Metrics vs. Loss Functions

* Loss functions are **used during training** to update your model.
* Metrics like **Hit Rate, NDCG, Precision@K, Recall@K** measure how good your recommendations are **from the user’s perspective**.
* Sometimes, optimizing a simple loss (like MSE) may not directly improve ranking metrics, so specialized ranking losses (e.g., BPR) are preferred.

---

### 3. Practical Considerations

* For web apps storing user information:

  * You may have **sparse interactions** → consider **matrix factorization with implicit feedback**.
  * Use **pairwise or listwise ranking losses** to improve actual recommendation relevance.
* Simply minimizing MSE may improve predicted ratings but not the top-K recommended items.

---

✅ **Bottom line:**
Yes, a loss function is essential to improve your model—but for content recommendation, you should choose a loss that aligns with **ranking/recommendation goals**, not just raw prediction accuracy.

If you want, I can suggest **specific loss functions tailored for web-based recommendation systems with implicit feedback**, including how to implement them efficiently. Do you want me to do that?
