Pancake Sorting is a **classic problem**. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

---

#  Pancake Sorting Problem

You are given an array of distinct integers. You can only use **prefix reversals** (i.e., flip the first `k` elements for some `k`).

Goal: Sort the array in ascending order using the minimum number of flips.

---

#  Key Ideas

1. **Operation = Prefix Reverse**

   * Choose `k`, reverse `arr[0:k]`.
   * Example: `[3, 6, 1, 5, 4]`, flip first 3 â†’ `[1, 6, 3, 5, 4]`.

2. **Strategy (Greedy)**

   * Start with the largest unsorted element.
   * Bring it to the front with one flip.
   * Then flip the whole unsorted portion to place it at the correct position.
   * Reduce problem size by 1 and repeat.

3. **Bound**

   * Worst case â‰¤ **2n â€“ 3 flips** (known result).

---

# ðŸ”¹ Example Walkthrough

Array = `[3, 2, 4, 1]`

1. Largest = `4` (index 2).

   * Flip(3) â†’ `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   * Flip(4) â†’ `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
2. Largest = `3` (index 1).

   * Flip(2) â†’ `[3, 1, 2, 4]`.
   * Flip(3) â†’ `[2, 1, 3, 4]`.
3. Largest = `2` (index 0).

   * Flip(2) â†’ `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Sorted in 5 flips.

# ðŸ”¹ Python Code

```python
def pancake_sort(arr):
    flips = []
    n = len(arr)
    
    for size in range(n, 1, -1):
        # Find index of the largest element in arr[0:size]
        max_idx = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_idx == size - 1:
            continue  # already in correct place
        
        # Step 1: bring max to front if not already
        if max_idx != 0:
            arr[:max_idx+1] = reversed(arr[:max_idx+1])
            flips.append(max_idx + 1)
        
        # Step 2: flip it into its correct position
        arr[:size] = reversed(arr[:size])
        flips.append(size)
    
    return flips, arr
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ Test It

```python
arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
flips, sorted_arr = pancake_sort(arr)
print("Flips sequence:", flips)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

Output:

```
Flips sequence: [3, 4, 2, 3, 2]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ Complexity

* Each step = at most 2 flips.
* For `n` elements â†’ at most `2n â€“ 3` flips.
* Time: `O(n^2)` (because of repeated `max()` + reversing slices).
* Can optimize with a heap or indexing trick.

âœ… Pancake sort is mainly used as a **teaching tool** (not practical in real life), but itâ€™s a **great interview question** because it combines **greedy strategy + array manipulation + bounding proofs**.

Do you want me to also show you how to **optimize pancake sort** (reduce the `O(n^2)` max search into `O(n log n)`) using a max-heap?
