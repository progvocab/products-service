Perfect follow-up âœ…

If youâ€™ve used

```bash
git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>
```

and want to commit with the **same commit message** as the original commit, you can do it easily.

---

### ðŸ§© Option 1: Use `--reuse-message`

```bash
git commit --reuse-message=<commit-hash>
```

or shorthand:

```bash
git commit -C <commit-hash>
```

ðŸ”¹ This reuses both the **commit message** and **author information** from the original commit.
ðŸ”¹ Example:

```bash
git cherry-pick -n abc123
git commit -C abc123
```

---

### ðŸ§© Option 2: Reuse the message only (not author)

If you just want the **message**, but commit as yourself:

```bash
git commit --reuse-message=<commit-hash> --reset-author
```

or interactively:

```bash
git commit -c <commit-hash>
```

(`-c` opens your editor with the old message prefilled â€” useful if you want to tweak it.)

### ðŸ§  Summary

| Command                               | Behavior                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `git commit -C <hash>`                | Commit with same message and author (no edit) |
| `git commit -c <hash>`                | Commit with same message but open editor      |
| `git commit -C <hash> --reset-author` | Commit with same message but as your user     |
| `git commit --reuse-message=<hash>`   | Same as `-C`                                  |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Apply changes without committing
git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>

# 2. Reuse the same commit message and author
git commit -C <commit-hash>
```

Would you like me to show what happens to the commit graph in both cases (`cherry-pick` vs `cherry-pick -n`)?
