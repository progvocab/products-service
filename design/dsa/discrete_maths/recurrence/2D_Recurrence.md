Letâ€™s carefully compare **binomial coefficients** (combinatorics formula) with a **2D recurrence** approach like Pascalâ€™s Triangle.

# ðŸ”¹ 1. Binomial Coefficient Formula

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

* **Direct closed-form formula**.
* Computes a **single value** efficiently (if factorials can be computed).
* Works well with **small/medium $n$** or with **modular arithmetic + precomputation**.
* Time complexity:

  * $O(1)$ with precomputed factorials.
  * $O(n)$ if factorials are computed directly each time.

---

# ðŸ”¹ 2. 2D Recurrence (Pascalâ€™s Identity)

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}, \quad \binom{n}{0}=\binom{n}{n}=1
$$

* **Recurrence relation**, depends on two values from the **previous row**.
* Naturally produces the entire **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**.
* Useful when you need **all values up to row $n$**.
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$ to build full triangle up to row $n$.

| **Efficiency (all values)**   | Must compute each separately             | Naturally builds all in $O(n^2)$                        |
| **Memory**                    | Just factorials array                    | Stores 2D triangle                                      |
| **Modular arithmetic**        | Needs modular inverse (Fermatâ€™s theorem) | Easy with DP, no division needed                        |

# ðŸ”¹ Example in Python

### Closed-Form (factorial)

```python
import math
print(math.comb(5, 2))  # 10
```

### Pascalâ€™s Triangle (DP)

```python
def pascal(n):
    C = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n+1):
        C[i][0] = C[i][i] = 1
        for j in range(1, i):
            C[i][j] = C[i-1][j-1] + C[i-1][j]
    return C

triangle = pascal(5)
print(triangle[5][2])  # 10
```

---

# ðŸ”¹ Big Picture

* **Binomial Coefficient** = a *mathematical object* (counting subsets, coefficients in expansion).
* **2D Recurrence (Pascalâ€™s Identity)** = a *way to compute binomial coefficients recursively*.

So: **Binomial coefficient is the result, recurrence is one of the ways to compute it.**

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also show how to compute $\binom{n}{k} \pmod{10^9+7}$ efficiently using **precomputed factorials + modular inverses**, which is the most common method in contests?
