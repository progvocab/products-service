Great question 👍 — heaps (priority queues) are super useful for **medium-level algorithmic problems** where you need efficient access to the smallest/largest element repeatedly.

Here are some **classic medium-level problems** solved using heaps, with explanations and Python code.

---

# 🔥 1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**

**Problem:** Given an unsorted array, find the `k`-th largest element.

👉 Use a **Min-Heap** of size `k`.

```python
import heapq

def kth_largest(nums, k):
    heap = nums[:k]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    for num in nums[k:]:
        if num > heap[0]:
            heapq.heapreplace(heap, num)
    return heap[0]

print(kth_largest([3,2,1,5,6,4], 2))  # Output: 5
```

* **Why heap?** Keeps only `k` largest elements → O(n log k).

---

# 🔥 2. **Top K Frequent Elements**

**Problem:** Given an array of numbers, return the `k` most frequent elements.

👉 Use a **Heap** sorted by frequency.

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def top_k_frequent(nums, k):
    freq = Counter(nums)
    return [item for item, _ in heapq.nlargest(k, freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])]

print(top_k_frequent([1,1,1,2,2,3], 2))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

* **Why heap?** Efficient way to get `k` max frequencies without sorting everything.

---

# 🔥 3. **Merge K Sorted Lists**

**Problem:** Merge `k` sorted linked lists into one sorted list.

👉 Use a **Min-Heap** to always pick the smallest head node.

```python
import heapq

def merge_k_sorted_lists(lists):
    heap = []
    for i, lst in enumerate(lists):
        if lst:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lst[0], i, 0))

    result = []
    while heap:
        val, li, idx = heapq.heappop(heap)
        result.append(val)
        if idx + 1 < len(lists[li]):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[li][idx + 1], li, idx + 1))
    return result

print(merge_k_sorted_lists([[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]))
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

* **Why heap?** Avoids merging lists all at once → O(N log k).

---

# 🔥 4. **Connect Ropes with Minimum Cost**

**Problem:** Given lengths of ropes, connect them into one rope with minimum cost (cost = sum of lengths connected).

👉 Use a **Min-Heap** to always pick two smallest ropes.

```python
import heapq

def min_cost_to_connect(ropes):
    heapq.heapify(ropes)
    total = 0
    while len(ropes) > 1:
        first = heapq.heappop(ropes)
        second = heapq.heappop(ropes)
        cost = first + second
        total += cost
        heapq.heappush(ropes, cost)
    return total

print(min_cost_to_connect([1,2,3,4,5]))  # Output: 33
```

* **Why heap?** Greedy choice with smallest ropes ensures minimal total cost.

---

# 🔥 5. **Sliding Window Maximum**

**Problem:** Find maximum in every sliding window of size `k`.

👉 Use a **Max-Heap** (or monotonic deque for optimal).

```python
import heapq

def sliding_window_max(nums, k):
    heap, result = [], []
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-n, i))  # store negative for max-heap
        while heap[0][1] <= i - k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(-heap[0][0])
    return result

print(sliding_window_max([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3))
# Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```

* **Why heap?** Efficiently tracks max element in window.

| Problem                 | Heap Type           | Key Idea                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Kth Largest Element     | Min-Heap (size k)   | Keep track of top k        |
| Top K Frequent Elements | Max-Heap / Min-Heap | Order by frequency         |
| Merge K Sorted Lists    | Min-Heap            | Pick smallest across lists |
| Connect Ropes Min Cost  | Min-Heap            | Greedy merge smallest      |
| Sliding Window Maximum  | Max-Heap            | Track max in window        |

👉 These are all **medium-level** problems where heaps give a big efficiency boost over brute-force.

Would you like me to also show you **Java versions** of these heap problems (using `PriorityQueue`), since you often work in Java + Spring Boot?
