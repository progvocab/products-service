Good question! Let’s break it clearly:

---

# **When should we use `RANK()` and `PARTITION BY` for an Employee table?**

You use **RANK()** and **PARTITION BY** when you want **relative rankings inside a group** — like per department, per city, per designation — **without aggregating** (i.e., you want individual rows with a ranking).

---

# **Typical Use Cases in Employee Table**

| Use Case | Why `RANK()` and `PARTITION BY` needed? | Example SQL |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:------------|
| Find top 3 salaried employees **per department** | Rank employees salary **inside each department** separately. | Use `PARTITION BY department_name` ORDER BY salary DESC |
| Find employees with **second highest salary per department** | Assign rank by salary per department and filter for rank 2. | Same, but `WHERE rnk = 2` |
| Find employees with same salary having **same rank** | Use `DENSE_RANK()` instead of simple `ROW_NUMBER()`. | `DENSE_RANK()` partitioned by department |
| Assign promotion eligibility rank **per location** | Partition by city and order by years of experience descending. | `PARTITION BY city` ORDER BY experience DESC |
| Find latest joined employee **per manager** | Partition by manager_id and order by joining_date DESC. | |
| Find highest number of reportees **per department** | Partition by department, order by number of reportees descending. | |

# **Example Query 1: Top 3 Employees by Salary Per Department**

```sql
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department_name, salary, rnk
FROM (
    SELECT 
        emp_id, 
        emp_name, 
        department_name, 
        salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_name ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM employees
)
WHERE rnk <= 3
ORDER BY department_name, rnk;
```
- Groups employees by **department_name**,
- Ranks them **by salary** inside each department,
- Picks **top 3**.

---

# **Example Query 2: Employee with Second Highest Salary per Department**

```sql
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, department_name, salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        emp_id, 
        emp_name, 
        department_name, 
        salary,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_name ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM employees
)
WHERE rnk = 2
ORDER BY department_name;
```

---

# **Simple way to understand**

- **`PARTITION BY`** = *Restart the ranking after every group* (e.g., department).
- **`ORDER BY`** = *How you sort inside the group* (e.g., highest salary first).
- **`RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()` / `ROW_NUMBER()`** = *How ties are handled.*

---

# **Design Patterns Applied**

- **Analytical Pattern**: analyzing rows without aggregation (unlike GROUP BY).
- **Windowing**: working with a "window" of rows related to current row.

---

# **Real World Business Examples**
| Scenario | SQL Logic |
|:---------|:----------|
| Year-end bonus to Top 2 performers per department | `RANK()` by sales per department |
| Identify employees eligible for international posting (Top 5 by experience per city) | `PARTITION BY city` |
| Salary hike for second top salaried employee per department | `WHERE rnk = 2` after `PARTITION BY department` |

Would you like me to also show **Spring Data JPA + native query** examples for this with an Employee entity?  
It’s a real-world scenario if you are building APIs like `/api/top-salaries-per-department`.  

Let me know! I'll prepare it quickly!
