Here's a **complete working example** of using Spring WebClient with `Flux` to continuously **publish** and **subscribe** to a streaming endpoint — a common scenario in event-driven systems or reactive APIs like SSE (Server-Sent Events).

---

### **Use Case**:  
Imagine a service that **publishes data** (e.g., sensor readings) every few seconds, and another service that **subscribes** to this stream and processes the data reactively.

---

### **1. Publisher Controller (SSE Stream)**

```java
@RestController
public class EventPublisherController {

    @GetMapping(value = "/stream", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
    public Flux<String> publishEvents() {
        return Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                   .map(i -> "Event #" + i)
                   .log();
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Subscriber Using WebClient with `Flux`**

```java
@Component
public class EventSubscriber {

    private final WebClient webClient;

    public EventSubscriber(WebClient.Builder builder) {
        this.webClient = builder.baseUrl("http://localhost:8080").build();
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void subscribeToStream() {
        webClient.get()
                 .uri("/stream")
                 .accept(MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)
                 .retrieve()
                 .bodyToFlux(String.class)
                 .subscribe(event -> {
                     System.out.println("Received: " + event);
                 });
    }
}
```

> `@PostConstruct` starts the subscription when the app boots.

---

### **3. Application Runner**

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class StreamingApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(StreamingApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

### **Output**

When the application starts, you’ll see:

```
Received: Event #0
Received: Event #1
Received: Event #2
...
```

---

### **Bonus Best Practices**

- Use `retry()` and `onErrorResume()` to make the subscriber resilient.
- Use `publishOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())` for async processing if the handling is heavy.
- Use backpressure control (`limitRate()`, buffering, etc.) for high-frequency streams.
