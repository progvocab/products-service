Ah, nice — you’re asking about **LeetCode 2009 – Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous**.

---

## 📌 Problem Restatement

You’re given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.
In one operation, you can replace any element with **any integer**.

An array is called **continuous** if:

* All elements are **distinct**
* The difference between the **maximum and minimum element** is exactly `n - 1`

i.e. the array must look like `{k, k+1, k+2, …, k+(n-1)}` in some order.

Return the **minimum number of operations** to make `nums` continuous.

---

## 🔑 Key Observations

1. A continuous array of length `n` is essentially some integer interval `[k, k+n-1]`.
   So we want to find the largest subset of `nums` that can fit into such an interval.

2. **Duplicates don’t help**, since the final array must have distinct elements.
   → Remove duplicates first.

3. The task reduces to finding the **maximum number of unique elements** that can fit into a sliding interval of length `n`.

4. The minimum number of operations =

   ```
   n - (maximum number of elements already fitting into a valid interval)
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Approach (Sliding Window + Sorting)

1. Remove duplicates: `arr = sorted(set(nums))`
2. Let `m = len(arr)` (unique count).
3. Use two pointers `i, j` (sliding window):

   * Expand `j` while `arr[j] - arr[i] < n`.
   * Track window size = `j - i`.
   * Maximize it.
4. Answer = `n - maxWindow`.

## ✅ Python Solution

```python
def minOperations(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    arr = sorted(set(nums))
    m = len(arr)
    
    ans = n
    j = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        while j < m and arr[j] < arr[i] + n:
            j += 1
        # arr[i] .. arr[j-1] fits in window of size < n
        maxWindow = j - i
        ans = min(ans, n - maxWindow)
    
    return ans
```

## 🔎 Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
nums = [4,2,5,3]
n = 4
arr = [2,3,4,5]
Sliding window [2..5] size=4 → maxWindow=4
Answer = 4 - 4 = 0
```

✅ Already continuous.

---

### Example 2

```
nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
n = 5
arr = [1,2,3,5,6]
Sliding windows:
- [1..5) → {1,2,3} size=3
- [2..6) → {2,3,5,6} size=4
maxWindow = 4
Answer = 5 - 4 = 1
```

✅ Replace 1 with 4 → \[2,3,4,5,6].

## ⏱️ Complexity

* Sorting: `O(n log n)`
* Sliding window: `O(n)`
* **Overall:** `O(n log n)`
* **Space:** `O(n)` (set for uniques)

Would you like me to also explain this with a **visual sliding window diagram** (how `i` and `j` move over `arr`)?
