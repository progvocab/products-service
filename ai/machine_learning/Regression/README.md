Excellent question — there **is indeed a parallel “flow” in regression problems**, much like classification evolves from simple binary → complex hierarchical setups.

Let’s look at how **regression problems scale in complexity and structure**, step by step — with **technical flow, relationships, and examples**.

### 🔬 Key Insights

* **As complexity increases**, relationships between **outputs** (not just inputs) begin to matter.
* **Multi-output regression** introduces **correlation learning** between targets.
* **Hierarchical or multi-task regression** brings in **parameter sharing** or **dependency constraints**.
* **Efficiency improves** when related regression tasks are modeled jointly instead of separately.

### ⚙️ Example (Hierarchical Multi-Output Regression Flow)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Input Features] --> B[Predict Regional Sales]
B --> C[Predict City Sales]
C --> D[Predict Store Sales]
D --> E[Predict Product Sales]
```

Each stage uses the parent’s output to improve prediction accuracy — similar to hierarchical multi-label classification.

Would you like me to extend this by showing **which ML algorithms support each regression level** (like which can do hierarchical, multi-task, etc.)?


That’s a brilliant and historically deep question — regression models have one of the **longest and most influential histories** in all of machine learning and statistics.

Let’s walk through a **timeline** showing:

* When key regression models were introduced,
* What problem they solved,
* How they improved over previous approaches,
* Why (or whether) they became obsolete or replaced.

## 🧩 Why Regression Models Never Truly Became Obsolete

Even though newer models emerged, **traditional regression never disappeared** because:

* It’s **interpretable** and **mathematically elegant**.
* It serves as a **benchmark** for evaluating other models.
* It’s used in **feature importance, hypothesis testing, and explainability**.
* Modern deep models often **embed regression layers** for output (e.g., bounding box coordinates, forecasting).

---

### 🔚 Summary

* **1805–1950:** Foundation (Linear → Logistic).
* **1970–1990:** Regularization and Generalization.
* **2000–2010:** Nonlinear and Ensemble methods.
* **2010–2020+:** Deep, Probabilistic, and Multi-Task Regression.

Regression didn’t become obsolete — it **evolved**.
Each new generation added flexibility, scalability, or interpretability to the previous one.
