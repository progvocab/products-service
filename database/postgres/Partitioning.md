To improve the performance of `SELECT` queries on large tables in **Oracle** or **PostgreSQL**, **partitioning** is a powerful technique. It allows you to **divide a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces**, called **partitions**, which can be scanned individually rather than scanning the entire table.

### **1. Partitioning in Oracle**

Oracle has advanced and flexible partitioning strategies:

#### **Types of Partitioning:**
- **Range Partitioning** (based on a column value range, e.g., dates)
- **List Partitioning** (based on discrete values, e.g., regions)
- **Hash Partitioning** (for even distribution)
- **Composite Partitioning** (combination, e.g., range + hash)

#### **Example – Range Partitioning (on a date column):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
  sale_id     NUMBER,
  sale_date   DATE,
  amount      NUMBER
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date) (
  PARTITION sales_2022 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-JAN-2023','DD-MON-YYYY')),
  PARTITION sales_2023 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('01-JAN-2024','DD-MON-YYYY')),
  PARTITION sales_max  VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

#### **Query Optimization:**
If you query by `sale_date`, Oracle will do **partition pruning**, meaning it will scan only relevant partitions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE '2023-01-01';
```

Oracle will skip `sales_2022` entirely.

### **2. Partitioning in PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL (since version 10) also supports **declarative partitioning**.

#### **Example – Range Partitioning:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
  sale_id     SERIAL,
  sale_date   DATE,
  amount      NUMERIC
) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);

CREATE TABLE sales_2022 PARTITION OF sales
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2023-01-01');

CREATE TABLE sales_2023 PARTITION OF sales
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');
```

PostgreSQL also supports **partition pruning** during query planning:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date = '2023-07-01';
```

This will show only `sales_2023` being scanned.

### **Tips to Improve Performance Using Partitioning**

| Tip                               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Choose the Right Partition Key** | Use columns that are frequently filtered (e.g., date, region).             |
| **Use Partition Pruning**        | Write queries that help the optimizer skip irrelevant partitions.          |
| **Index Partitions**             | Create indexes on partitioned tables or individual partitions.             |
| **Avoid Global Indexes (Oracle)**| Prefer local indexes in Oracle for partitioned tables to reduce overhead. |
| **Analyze and Vacuum (Postgres)**| Keep stats updated with `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` to help the planner.       |
