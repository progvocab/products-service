Perfect üëç ‚Äî just like there are different **learning paradigms**, there are also different **inference (prediction) modes** depending on how/when the trained model is used.

# üîπ Types of Model Inference

## 1. **Batch Inference**

* **What**: Predictions are made for **large datasets at once** (offline).
* **How**:

  * Input: A whole dataset (millions of rows).
  * Model runs once or in chunks.
  * Predictions stored in a database, file, or data warehouse.
* **When to use**:

  * Predictions don‚Äôt need to be instant.
  * Data comes in bulk (daily/hourly).
* ‚úÖ **Examples**:

  * Credit risk scoring for all customers every night.
  * Product recommendations updated daily.
  * Forecasting sales at the end of each week.

## 2. **Real-Time (Online) Inference**

* **What**: Predictions are made **instantly per request**.
* **How**:

  * A user/system sends input ‚Üí model responds immediately.
  * Low-latency requirements (milliseconds).
* **When to use**:

  * Time-sensitive decisions.
* ‚úÖ **Examples**:

  * Fraud detection during a transaction.
  * Voice assistants (speech ‚Üí text).
  * Real-time personalization (e.g., YouTube/Netflix recommendations).

---

## 3. **Streaming (Near Real-Time) Inference**

* **What**: Predictions made continuously from **event streams**.
* **How**:

  * Data flows via Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming, etc.
  * Model evaluates each event/window.
* **When to use**:

  * High-volume, fast-arriving data.
* ‚úÖ **Examples**:

  * Sensor data in IoT (predict machine failure).
  * Stock market anomaly detection.
  * Live user activity analysis (fraud, ads).

---

## 4. **Edge Inference**

* **What**: Model runs **locally on edge devices** (mobile, IoT, embedded systems).
* **How**:

  * Optimized models (e.g., TensorRT, ONNX, TFLite).
  * Runs without constant server/cloud connection.
* **When to use**:

  * Latency, privacy, offline capability.
* ‚úÖ **Examples**:

  * Face unlock on smartphones.
  * Self-driving car object detection.
  * Smart home assistants (wake-word detection).

---

## 5. **Hybrid (Batch + Real-Time) Inference**

* **What**: Mix of batch + real-time, depending on the use case.
* **How**:

  * Precompute bulk predictions in **batch**.
  * Refine/update in **real-time** for fresh data.
* ‚úÖ **Examples**:

  * E-commerce: batch recommendations + real-time ‚Äúrecently viewed‚Äù.
  * Banking: batch risk scoring + real-time fraud alerts.

| Type          | Latency       | Scale              | Use Case Examples              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Batch**     | Minutes‚ÄìHours | Large datasets     | Risk scoring, analytics        |
| **Real-Time** | ms‚Äìseconds    | Per request        | Fraud detection, chatbots      |
| **Streaming** | ms‚Äìseconds    | Continuous streams | IoT sensors, market monitoring |
| **Edge**      | ms            | Local devices      | Face unlock, self-driving cars |
| **Hybrid**    | Mixed         | Both               | RecSys, banking                |

‚ö° If you‚Äôd like, I can also show you an **architecture diagram** (cloud + Kafka + DB + edge device) that compares how **batch vs real-time inference pipelines** look in deployment.

Would you like me to draw that?
