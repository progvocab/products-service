Excellent question üîê ‚Äî and very relevant to modern cryptography.

RSA has been around since the 1970s, but today it‚Äôs considered **outdated for many encryption use cases** ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù but because **it‚Äôs slower, easier to misuse, and less secure per bit length** compared to modern elliptic-curve and hybrid methods.

Let‚Äôs break this down properly üëá

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why not RSA for encryption anymore?

RSA:

* Requires **large key sizes (2048‚Äì4096 bits)** for modern security.
* Is **slow**, especially for encrypting large data.
* Is **deterministic** unless used with padding (OAEP), which adds complexity.
* Can‚Äôt encrypt large data directly ‚Äî only small payloads (usually symmetric keys).

## üß© Recommended Secure Approach: **Elliptic Curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (X25519) + AES-GCM**

### ‚Üí Concept

1. Each party generates an **X25519 key pair**.
2. They exchange **public keys**.
3. Both derive a **shared secret** using ECDH.
4. That secret is stretched into an **AES key**.
5. AES-GCM encrypts the actual data.

### ‚úÖ Python Example (Modern Secure Encryption)

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import x25519
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate X25519 key pairs (for two parties)
private_key_a = x25519.X25519PrivateKey.generate()
private_key_b = x25519.X25519PrivateKey.generate()

public_key_a = private_key_a.public_key()
public_key_b = private_key_b.public_key()

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Derive shared secrets
shared_key_a = private_key_a.exchange(public_key_b)
shared_key_b = private_key_b.exchange(public_key_a)

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Derive symmetric AES key from shared secret
def derive_key(shared_secret):
    return HKDF(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=None,
        info=b"x25519 aes encryption"
    ).derive(shared_secret)

aes_key = derive_key(shared_key_a)

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypt a message using AES-GCM
aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)
nonce = os.urandom(12)
message = b"Highly confidential data"

ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, message, None)
print("‚úÖ Encrypted:", ciphertext)

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Decrypt
plaintext = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, None)
print("üîì Decrypted:", plaintext.decode())
```

### üß© What this does:

* Uses **X25519** ‚Üí modern elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman.
* Derives a shared key securely (perfect forward secrecy).
* Uses **AES-GCM**, a modern **authenticated encryption** algorithm (integrity + confidentiality).
* Avoids direct RSA encryption ‚Äî much more secure & efficient.

## üß† TL;DR

| Technique                | Security     | Speed     | Notes                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| **RSA-2048**             | Medium       | Slow      | Legacy, OK for signatures |
| **RSA-4096**             | Good         | Very slow | Still not PQ-safe         |
| **X25519 + AES-GCM**     | Excellent    | Very fast | Standard in TLS 1.3       |
| **ChaCha20-Poly1305**    | Excellent    | Very fast | Good for mobile           |
| **Kyber (Post-Quantum)** | Future-proof | Moderate  | Still experimental        |

‚úÖ **Conclusion:**
For new systems, **don‚Äôt use RSA for encryption**.
Use:

* **X25519 + AES-GCM** ‚Üí modern asymmetric + symmetric combo, or
* **ChaCha20-Poly1305** for mobile devices.

Would you like me to extend this example to a **hybrid encryption workflow for large files** (i.e., encrypt file with AES, then encrypt AES key using X25519)?
