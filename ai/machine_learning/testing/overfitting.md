Understanding **overfitting** and **underfitting** is critical in building effective machine learning models. These are fundamental issues related to how well your model generalizes to unseen data.

## 🔍 Definitions

### ✅ **Underfitting**

* **What:** The model is too simple to learn the underlying pattern.
* **Symptoms:**

  * **High training error**
  * **High validation error**
* **Cause:** Model can’t capture the complexity of the data.
* **Example:** Using linear regression for a clearly non-linear problem.

### ✅ **Overfitting**

* **What:** The model learns the training data *too well*, including noise.
* **Symptoms:**

  * **Low training error**
  * **High validation error**
* **Cause:** Model is too complex (e.g., deep neural nets with little regularization).
* **Example:** A decision tree that memorizes data instead of generalizing.

## 🧪 How to Detect

| Metric              | Underfitting                                      | Overfitting                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Training Accuracy   | Low                                               | High                                        |
| Validation Accuracy | Low                                               | Low                                         |
| Training Loss       | High                                              | Low                                         |
| Validation Loss     | High                                              | High                                        |
| Learning Curves     | Training and validation curves stay high and flat | Training curve improves, validation worsens |

## 🛠️ How to Fix

### 🔄 Fixing Underfitting:

* ✅ Use more complex models (e.g., deeper neural nets, ensemble models)
* ✅ Add more features (feature engineering)
* ✅ Reduce regularization
* ✅ Train longer (increase epochs)

### 🔄 Fixing Overfitting:

* ✅ Add more training data
* ✅ Use **regularization** (L1/L2, Dropout)
* ✅ Use **early stopping**
* ✅ Use **simpler models**
* ✅ Data augmentation (in image/NLP)
* ✅ Cross-validation (to detect overfitting early)

---

## ✅ Python Example: Detecting Overfitting with Train/Test Scores

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, model.predict(X_train))
test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))

print(f"Train Accuracy: {train_acc:.2f}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc:.2f}")
```

* **If train accuracy >> test accuracy → Overfitting**
* **If both are low → Underfitting**
