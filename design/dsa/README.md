# ðŸ”Ž 1. A Priori Analysis (Before Execution)

* **Definition**: Analysis of an algorithmâ€™s efficiency **theoretically before implementation or execution**.
* Focuses on:

  * **Time Complexity** â†’ number of steps as a function of input size `n`.
  * **Space Complexity** â†’ memory usage as a function of `n`.

ðŸ‘‰ It is **machine-independent**.
We use mathematical models (Big-O, Big-Î©, Big-Î˜) to describe growth.

### Example (Python)

Letâ€™s analyze **linear search** *a priori*.

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):   # loop runs at most n times
        if arr[i] == target:   # constant time comparison
            return i
    return -1
```

**A Priori Analysis:**

* Best case â†’ `O(1)` (target at first position)
* Worst case â†’ `O(n)` (target at last position or not present)
* Space complexity â†’ `O(1)` (no extra space except a few variables)

So, *before running code*, we know time grows linearly.

# ðŸ”Ž 2. A Posteriori Analysis (After Execution)

* **Definition**: Analysis of an algorithmâ€™s efficiency **after implementing and executing it** on real hardware.
* Focuses on:

  * **Actual running time** (in seconds, milliseconds, etc.)
  * **Actual memory usage**
* Depends on:

  * Input size
  * Hardware (CPU speed, cache, RAM)
  * Compiler/interpreter

ðŸ‘‰ It is **machine-dependent** and relies on experimental results.

### Example (Python)

Letâ€™s measure linear search execution time using `time` module.

```python
import time
import random

def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Prepare data
n = 10**6
arr = list(range(n))
target = n - 1   # worst case

# A Posteriori analysis
start = time.time()
result = linear_search(arr, target)
end = time.time()

print("Found at index:", result)
print("Execution time (seconds):", end - start)
```

Sample output (depends on your machine):

```
Found at index: 999999
Execution time (seconds): 0.15
```

This gives us **empirical evidence** about performance.

âœ… In short:

* **A Priori** â†’ Predict performance before running code (theory).
* **A Posteriori** â†’ Measure performance after running code (experiment).

Would you like me to also give an **example where a priori analysis suggests two algorithms are similar (both O(n log n)), but a posteriori analysis shows one is much faster in practice**? Thatâ€™s often used to explain why both analyses are important.
