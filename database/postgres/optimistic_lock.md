### **Optimistic Locking vs. Pessimistic Locking in PostgreSQL**  

Locking is essential in PostgreSQL to maintain data consistency when multiple transactions access the same data. PostgreSQL supports both **Optimistic Locking** and **Pessimistic Locking**, each with its own use case.

---

## **1. Optimistic Locking**  
✅ **Best for:** **High-read, low-write** workloads where conflicts are rare.  
✅ **Prevents conflicts without using database locks.**  

### **How It Works:**  
- Instead of locking rows, it **checks if data was modified** before updating.  
- Uses a **version number** (or timestamp) to detect conflicts.  
- If data was **modified by another transaction**, the update fails, and the application must retry.  

### **Example: Implementing Optimistic Locking in PostgreSQL**
#### **Step 1: Create a Table with a Version Column**
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    price NUMERIC,
    version INT DEFAULT 1
);
```
#### **Step 2: First Transaction Reads the Data**
```sql
SELECT id, name, price, version FROM products WHERE id = 1;
```
- Suppose `version = 1`.

#### **Step 3: Attempt to Update with Version Check**
```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 120, version = version + 1
WHERE id = 1 AND version = 1;
```
- If another transaction **modified the row and changed the version**, this update **fails**.
- The application must **retry the transaction**.

✅ **Advantages of Optimistic Locking:**  
- No actual database locks → **better performance**.  
- Ideal for systems with **more reads than writes** (e.g., user profiles, product catalogs).  

❌ **Disadvantages:**  
- If conflicts happen often, **many updates fail**, leading to retries.

## **2. Pessimistic Locking**  
✅ **Best for:** **High-write, high-contention** scenarios where conflicts are common.  
✅ **Prevents conflicts by locking rows before updating.**  

### **How It Works:**  
- A row is **locked before modification** to prevent other transactions from changing it.  
- Ensures **only one transaction** can modify the data at a time.  

### **Example: Implementing Pessimistic Locking in PostgreSQL**
#### **Step 1: Select the Row and Lock It**
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
```
- This **locks the row** so other transactions **must wait**.

#### **Step 2: Update the Locked Row**
```sql
UPDATE products SET price = 120 WHERE id = 1;
```

#### **Step 3: Commit the Transaction**
```sql
COMMIT;
```
- Other transactions waiting on the lock **can now proceed**.

✅ **Advantages of Pessimistic Locking:**  
- Ensures **strong consistency**.  
- Avoids conflicts by **blocking other transactions**.  

❌ **Disadvantages:**  
- Can cause **deadlocks** if multiple transactions wait on each other.  
- Slower than optimistic locking due to **waiting transactions**.

## **3. Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking: Key Differences**
| Feature              | Optimistic Locking | Pessimistic Locking |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Best For**         | Read-heavy workloads | Write-heavy workloads |
| **How It Works**     | Checks for conflicts before update | Locks rows before update |
| **Performance**      | Fast (no locks) | Slower (locks rows) |
| **Risk of Conflicts?** | Yes (if many updates happen at once) | No (only one transaction modifies a row) |
| **Common Use Cases** | Inventory updates, user profiles | Bank transactions, ticket booking |

---

## **4. When to Use Which?**
✅ **Use Optimistic Locking if:**  
- Conflicts are rare.  
- You need **high concurrency** and performance.  
- Example: **E-commerce product prices, user profile updates**.  

✅ **Use Pessimistic Locking if:**  
- Conflicts are frequent.  
- You need **strong consistency**.  
- Example: **Bank account transfers, airline seat booking**.  

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Optimistic Locking** → **Fast, but may require retries.**  
- **Pessimistic Locking** → **Ensures consistency, but may cause delays.**  
- PostgreSQL **supports both**, and the choice depends on your application needs.
