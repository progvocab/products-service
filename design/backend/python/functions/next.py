The `next()` function in Python is used to **retrieve the next item from an iterator**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Syntax:**

```python
next(iterator, default)
```

* **`iterator`**: An iterable object (like a generator or something returned from `iter()`).
* **`default`** *(optional)*: A value to return **if the iterator is exhausted**. If not provided and the iterator is exhausted, it raises `StopIteration`.

---

### üß† **Why use `next()`?**

* To **manually iterate** through an iterable.
* To **get the first match** in a generator expression.
* To **avoid full loops** when only the first item is needed.

---

### üìò **Examples:**

#### 1. Basic usage:

```python
nums = iter([10, 20, 30])
print(next(nums))  # 10
print(next(nums))  # 20
```

#### 2. Using default:

```python
nums = iter([1])
print(next(nums))        # 1
print(next(nums, 'end')) # 'end'
```

#### 3. With generator expression:

```python
squares = (x*x for x in range(10))
print(next(squares))  # 0
print(next(squares))  # 1
```

#### 4. Find first match using `next()` and generator:

```python
nums = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
first_odd = next((x for x in nums if x % 2 == 1), None)
print(first_odd)  # 7
```

### üîÅ `next()` vs `for` loop:

* `for` loops automatically call `next()` behind the scenes.
* `next()` gives you **manual control** over the iteration.
