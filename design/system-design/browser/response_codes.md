## üåê HTTP Status Codes Overview

HTTP response codes are **standardized numeric responses** returned by a server to indicate the **result** of a client‚Äôs request.
They are grouped into five classes:

| Code Range | Category      | Meaning                                          |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1xx**    | Informational | Request received, continuing process             |
| **2xx**    | Success       | Request successfully received and processed      |
| **3xx**    | Redirection   | Further action required (redirects, cache, etc.) |
| **4xx**    | Client Error  | Request error due to client                      |
| **5xx**    | Server Error  | Request failed due to server                     |
