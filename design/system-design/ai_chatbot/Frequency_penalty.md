Great question 👌 — this one is about **controlling repetition in LLM outputs**. Let’s go step by step.

## 🔹 What is Frequency Penalty?

* The **frequency penalty** is a parameter used during **LLM token sampling** to discourage the model from repeating the same words/tokens too often.
* It works by **decreasing the probability of a token that has already appeared in the generated text**.

Mathematically, during generation:

$$
P'(token) = \frac{P(token)}{(1 + \text{frequency_penalty} \times \text{count}(token))}
$$

* `frequency_penalty = 0.0` → No penalty, repetition is allowed.
* `frequency_penalty = 1.0` → Moderate penalty.
* `frequency_penalty = 2.0` → Strong penalty, model avoids repeated words heavily.

## 🔹 Example

Prompt: *"Write a short poem about stars."*

* **No frequency penalty (0.0):**

  ```
  Stars shine bright, stars light the night, stars guide us home, stars in the sky.
  ```

* **With frequency penalty (1.2):**

  ```
  Stars sparkle above, guiding the lost, painting the sky with silver and frost.
  ```

Notice: Fewer "stars" repeats, more vocabulary variety.

## 🔹 How to Make It Variable in System Design

To make **frequency penalty configurable by the user**, follow the same idea as **temperature**:

### 1. **OpenAI API Example**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a poem about stars"}],
    temperature=0.7,
    frequency_penalty=1.2  # 👈 variable
)
```

### 2. **Hugging Face Transformers Example**

```python
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.7,
    repetition_penalty=1.2   # HF uses repetition_penalty (similar effect)
)
```

---

## 🔹 System Design Integration

1. **Frontend/UI**

   * Provide a slider or input box for **frequency penalty** (range: `0.0–2.0`).
   * Label it like: *“Repetition Control”*.

2. **Backend API**

   ```json
   POST /chat
   {
     "prompt": "Tell me a story",
     "temperature": 0.8,
     "frequency_penalty": 1.0
   }
   ```

3. **Orchestrator**

   * Reads user input.
   * Passes `frequency_penalty` along with `temperature` to the model inference.

4. **LLM Inference**

   * Uses penalty during token probability adjustment before sampling.

✅ **Design Benefits**

* Users can tune for **creative vs. repetitive** style.
* Helpful in **content generation, summaries, or poetry** where variety matters.
* You can even auto-adjust based on use case:

  * **High penalty** → for summarization, FAQs.
  * **Low penalty** → for code generation, where repetition may be needed.
