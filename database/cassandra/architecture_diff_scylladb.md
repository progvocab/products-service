## **2️⃣ Core Architectural Differences**
### **🔹 1. Language and Performance**
- **Cassandra** is written in **Java** and runs on the **JVM**, which introduces **garbage collection (GC) pauses** and increased memory usage.
- **ScyllaDB** is written in **C++**, eliminating **JVM overhead** and making it more memory-efficient.

### **🔹 2. CPU & Parallelism**
- **Cassandra** uses a **thread-per-request model**, meaning each query spawns a separate thread.
- **ScyllaDB** uses a **shard-per-core model**, where each core handles a specific set of data, avoiding unnecessary context switching.

### **🔹 3. Compaction & Garbage Collection**
- **Cassandra** suffers from **GC pauses**, which impact performance under heavy loads.
- **ScyllaDB** has **no JVM GC**, and its **compaction process** is **asynchronous and background-optimized**, preventing slowdowns.

### **🔹 4. Data Partitioning**
- Both use **consistent hashing** for distributing data across nodes.
- **ScyllaDB** optimizes data locality to **reduce cross-node communication**.

### **🔹 5. Write & Read Performance**
- **ScyllaDB** claims **2-10x better write throughput** and **significantly lower read latency** than Cassandra.
- **Cassandra** is still widely used but requires more **tuning** for high performance.

## **3️⃣ Architecture Comparison**
### **🔹 Cassandra Architecture**
- **Masterless, peer-to-peer topology**
- **Java-based execution (JVM overhead)**
- **Data is partitioned and replicated across nodes**
- **Reads/Writes use an internal coordinator to route queries**
- **Compaction + GC can cause unpredictable latency spikes**

Great question 👍 — this gets into the **design philosophy of Cassandra vs ScyllaDB**, and whether choosing a **concurrent garbage collector in the JVM** closes the performance gap.

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

## 🔹 1. Cassandra and the JVM GC

* **Cassandra** is written in **Java**, so it depends on the **JVM’s garbage collector**.
* Even if you use a **concurrent GC** like **G1, ZGC, Shenandoah**, you *still* pay costs:

  * **Pause times**: although shorter, they’re not zero.
  * **Write/read barriers**: e.g., ZGC and Shenandoah insert memory barriers in every object access, adding overhead.
  * **Heap management**: Cassandra’s data model creates lots of short-lived and long-lived objects, stressing the heap.
* Cassandra’s performance is sensitive to heap tuning, GC tuning, and allocation patterns.

So even with a concurrent GC, there is **overhead baked into the JVM model**.

---

## 🔹 2. ScyllaDB’s Design

* **ScyllaDB** is a rewrite of Cassandra in **C++** using the **Seastar framework**.
* Seastar uses **shard-per-core** architecture:

  * Each CPU core runs its own reactor loop.
  * No shared memory or locks across cores → eliminates GC + thread contention.
* Memory management:

  * ScyllaDB has its own allocator, avoids GC entirely.
  * Allocations are predictable, and long-lived data is pinned in place.
* Result: predictable **low latency (99.999% tail)** and **much higher throughput** than Cassandra.

---

## 🔹 3. Why GC ≠ Scylla Performance

Even if you configure Cassandra with **ZGC or Shenandoah**, you don’t get Scylla-level performance because:

| Factor                     | Cassandra (Java, Concurrent GC)               | ScyllaDB (C++, Seastar)                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **GC Overhead**            | Always some barriers, metadata, write costs   | None (manual allocators, no GC)          |
| **Pause Times**            | Small, but nonzero (few ms possible)          | Zero (no GC at all)                      |
| **Memory Locality**        | JVM heap fragmentation + object indirection   | Shard-per-core, NUMA-aware memory pools  |
| **Threading Model**        | Multiple threads, locks, context switches     | Event loop per core, lock-free           |
| **Tail Latency (p99.999)** | Still affected by JVM GC safepoints, barriers | Extremely predictable, microsecond-level |

So, **Concurrent GC makes Cassandra better**, but it **can’t remove the JVM abstraction overhead**. ScyllaDB wins by never having GC in the first place.

---

## 🔹 4. Real Benchmark Numbers

* Vendors have published **ScyllaDB vs Cassandra benchmarks**:

  * ScyllaDB often delivers **10x–20x higher throughput**.
  * Tail latencies (p99, p999) are **orders of magnitude lower** in Scylla.
  * Even with ZGC, Cassandra shows **pause spikes** under high load.

---

## 🔹 5. Bottom Line

👉 **No, Cassandra with a concurrent GC will not have the same performance as ScyllaDB.**

* Concurrent GC reduces pause times but introduces **runtime barriers and CPU overhead**.
* JVM safepoints, object model, and heap fragmentation still cause unpredictability.
* ScyllaDB avoids the GC problem entirely with its **C++ shard-per-core model**, so it’s fundamentally more efficient.

---

✅ If your use case is **low-latency, high-throughput, predictable performance (especially at scale)** → ScyllaDB will always outperform Cassandra, even with the best GC tuning.
✅ If you want **ecosystem maturity, flexibility, JVM familiarity** → Cassandra with concurrent GC is still viable, just less predictable.
