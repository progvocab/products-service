Good question üëç ‚Äî in AWS, **signed URL** and **pre-signed URL** sound similar but have slightly different meanings depending on the context. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üîë **1. Pre-Signed URL (S3 context)**

* **Where used:** Most commonly with **Amazon S3**.
* **What it is:** A URL to an S3 object that is signed **in advance** by someone with valid AWS credentials.
* **Purpose:** Allows temporary access (download or upload) to a private S3 object without exposing credentials.
* **Access control:** The URL includes:

  * Object key (file path)
  * Expiration time
  * Signature (based on IAM user/role permissions)
* **Typical use case:**

  * Give a client 5 minutes to download an object.
  * Allow a web app to upload directly to S3 without exposing AWS credentials.

üëâ Example:

```
https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/myfile.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=...
```

### üîë **2. Signed URL (CloudFront / API Gateway / General AWS usage)**

* **Where used:**

  * **CloudFront Signed URLs** (for private distributions).
  * Also used in a general sense for "any URL signed with credentials".
* **What it is:** A URL that has been cryptographically signed to grant **restricted access** to a resource (like video streams, private content).
* **Access control:** Based on CloudFront key pair or custom policies (IP range, date range, etc.).
* **Typical use case:**

  * Distribute premium video content only to paying users.
  * Control access to API Gateway endpoints.

üëâ Example:

```
https://d123.cloudfront.net/movie.mp4?Expires=1678901234&Signature=AbCdEf123...&Key-Pair-Id=APKA...
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Comparison**

| Feature           | Pre-Signed URL (S3)                                      | Signed URL (CloudFront / General)                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**         | S3 objects                                               | CloudFront distributions, APIs, other AWS services        |
| **Generated by**  | AWS SDK / CLI using IAM credentials                      | CloudFront key pair or service-specific signing mechanism |
| **Access type**   | Temporary access to specific S3 object (download/upload) | Temporary or conditional access to private content        |
| **Customization** | Mostly expiration time and allowed action                | Expiration, IP restrictions, custom policies              |
| **Use case**      | Upload/download files securely to S3                     | Secure streaming, CDN distribution, private APIs          |

‚úÖ **In short:**

* **Pre-signed URL** ‚Üí AWS SDK/CLI generated URL to access **S3** objects temporarily.
* **Signed URL** ‚Üí Broader term, usually for **CloudFront or other AWS services**, with more flexible access policies.

Do you want me to also show you **when to use CloudFront signed URLs vs. S3 pre-signed URLs** (since both can protect S3 objects but are used differently)?
