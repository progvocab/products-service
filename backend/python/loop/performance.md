Great question! Let's clarify:

### **No, `inline` in C++ is NOT like a Python feature you call — it’s a **compile-time hint**, not a runtime construct.**

---

### **C++ `inline` vs Python Function Calls in Loops**

#### **C++**
- `inline` is a **compile-time request** to **avoid function call overhead** by replacing the function call with its body.
- It's mostly used in **tight loops**, **short utility functions**, etc.

```cpp
inline int square(int x) { return x * x; }

for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
    sum += square(i); // compiler may "inline" this function
}
```

- Modern compilers **automatically inline** small functions during optimization, even without the `inline` keyword.

#### **Python**
- Python **does not have inlining**; every function call involves overhead because it's an interpreted (or bytecode-compiled) dynamic language.
- You may see **manual inlining** in performance-critical code (writing the logic directly in the loop), or use of tools like **NumPy**, **Cython**, or **JIT compilation** (via **Numba**, **PyPy**) for optimization.

### **Performance Tip in Python**
To speed up loops:
- Avoid function calls in performance-critical loops.
- Use libraries like NumPy or apply JIT with Numba.
- Consider rewriting hot code paths in C/C++ and wrapping with Python (e.g., via `ctypes`, `cffi`, or `pybind11`).

### **Summary**

| Feature         | C++                                      | Python                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `inline`         | Compiler hint for function body insertion | Not available                    |
| Performance Gain | Reduces function call overhead            | Use NumPy, Numba, Cython for speed |
