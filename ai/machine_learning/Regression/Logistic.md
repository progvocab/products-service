 Let’s walk through a **real-world simple use case of Logistic Regression** step by step, with explanation, math (logit), and Python code.

---

## 🎯 Use Case: Predicting if a Student Passes an Exam

We want to predict whether a student **passes (1)** or **fails (0)** an exam based on the **number of study hours**.

---

## 📊 The Data

Suppose we collected data from students:

| Study Hours | Pass (1)/Fail (0) |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | 0                 |
| 2           | 0                 |
| 3           | 0                 |
| 4           | 1                 |
| 5           | 1                 |
| 6           | 1                 |
| 7           | 1                 |

* **Feature (X):** Study Hours
* **Target (Y):** Pass/Fail

This is **binary classification**.

---

## 📐 The Model

Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output, **logistic regression predicts probabilities**:

$$
P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X)}}
$$

* $\beta_0$: intercept
* $\beta_1$: slope (effect of study hours on passing)

---

## 🧮 The Logit

Logistic regression uses the **logit (log-odds)** function:

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \ln \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$

* If study hours increase, the log-odds of passing increase linearly.

---

## 🏋️ Training

Training = finding the best $\beta_0, \beta_1$ that maximize the likelihood of observing the data.

We’ll use **scikit-learn** to train the model.

---

## 🐍 Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# --- Data ---
data = {
    "study_hours": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    "pass_exam":   [0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

X = df[["study_hours"]]
y = df["pass_exam"]

# --- Train Model ---
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# --- Model Parameters ---
print("Intercept (β0):", model.intercept_[0])
print("Slope (β1):", model.coef_[0][0])

# --- Predict Probabilities ---
hours = np.linspace(0,8,100).reshape(-1,1)
probs = model.predict_proba(hours)[:,1]

# --- Plot ---
plt.scatter(df["study_hours"], df["pass_exam"], color="red", label="Actual Data")
plt.plot(hours, probs, color="blue", label="Logistic Curve")
plt.xlabel("Study Hours")
plt.ylabel("Probability of Passing")
plt.title("Logistic Regression: Study Hours vs Pass Probability")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

---

## ✅ What Happens

1. The model learns a **sigmoid curve** instead of a straight line.
2. For low hours, probability ≈ 0 (fail).
3. For high hours, probability ≈ 1 (pass).
4. The **decision boundary** (where p=0.5) is the “threshold” for predicting pass/fail.

---

👉 This is one of the simplest real-world logistic regression use cases.

### **the manual calculation of logit & probability using the learned coefficients**

Let’s continue with the **manual calculation** using the learned coefficients from our logistic regression model.

---

## 🧮 Step 1: Recall the Logistic Equation

$$
P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X)}}
$$

and the **logit (log-odds)** is

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
$$

---

## 🏋️ Step 2: Get Model Coefficients

From our Python code:

```python
print("Intercept (β0):", model.intercept_[0])
print("Slope (β1):", model.coef_[0][0])
```

For this dataset, suppose the model gives something like:

* $\beta_0 = -4.077$
* $\beta_1 = 1.236$

(These numbers might vary slightly depending on scikit-learn’s solver, but they’ll be close.)

---

## 📐 Step 3: Manual Logit & Probability Calculation

Let’s calculate for a student who studied **3 hours**:

1. Compute the logit (linear part):

   $$
   z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X = -4.077 + 1.236 \times 3 = -0.369
   $$

2. Convert logit to probability using the sigmoid:

   $$
   P(Y=1|X=3) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(-0.369)}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{0.369}} \approx 0.409
   $$

So the probability of **passing with 3 hours of study ≈ 41%**.
Since this is below 0.5, the model predicts **Fail (0)**.

---

Now try **6 hours**:

1. Logit:

   $$
   z = -4.077 + 1.236 \times 6 = 3.339
   $$

2. Probability:

   $$
   P(Y=1|X=6) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-3.339}} \approx 0.965
   $$

So the probability of **passing with 6 hours of study ≈ 96%** → Predict **Pass (1)**.

---

## 🐍 Python: Manual vs Model

We can verify this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

beta0 = model.intercept_[0]
beta1 = model.coef_[0][0]

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

# Manual calc for 3 and 6 hours
for hours in [3, 6]:
    z = beta0 + beta1 * hours
    prob = sigmoid(z)
    print(f"Study Hours: {hours}, Logit (z): {z:.3f}, Probability: {prob:.3f}")
```

---

✅ This way, you see how the **logit (linear function)** transforms into a **probability (sigmoid curve)**.

Do you want me to also explain **how the decision boundary (cutoff point ≈ where prob = 0.5)** can be found directly from the coefficients?
