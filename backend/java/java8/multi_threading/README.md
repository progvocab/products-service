Letâ€™s go through the **important multithreading concepts in Java** with short, clear explanations.

# ðŸ”¹ Key Multithreading Concepts in Java

| Concept                            | Explanation                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thread**                         | A lightweight unit of execution. In Java, created by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`.           |
| **Thread Lifecycle**               | States: `New â†’ Runnable â†’ Running â†’ Waiting/Blocked â†’ Terminated`. Managed by JVM and OS.                     |
| **Thread Priorities**              | Each thread has a priority (`1` to `10`). JVM/OS uses it for scheduling (but not guaranteed).                 |
| **Runnable Interface**             | Defines the `run()` method. Preferred way to create threads (decouples task from thread).                     |
| **Callable & Future**              | `Callable<V>` returns a result and can throw exceptions. `Future` represents the result of async computation. |
| **Executor Framework**             | Provides a high-level API (`ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`) for managing thread pools.                |
| **Synchronization**                | Mechanism to control access to shared resources. Done with `synchronized` keyword or locks.                   |
| **Lock Interface (ReentrantLock)** | Provides explicit locking/unlocking, more flexible than `synchronized`.                                       |
| **Volatile Keyword**               | Ensures visibility of variable updates across threads. Prevents caching in thread-local memory.               |
| **Atomic Variables**               | (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, etc.) provide lock-free thread-safe operations.                               |
| **ThreadLocal**                    | Each thread has its own isolated copy of a variable. Useful for user sessions, request context.               |
| **Wait, Notify, NotifyAll**        | Methods used for inter-thread communication on objectsâ€™ monitors.                                             |
| **Deadlock**                       | Situation where two or more threads wait indefinitely for each otherâ€™s resources.                             |
| **Livelock**                       | Threads keep changing state in response to each other but never make progress.                                |
| **Starvation**                     | A thread never gets CPU time/resources due to low priority or scheduling.                                     |
| **Thread Pools**                   | Reuse fixed number of threads to improve performance (`Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`).                      |
| **Fork/Join Framework**            | Splits tasks into smaller subtasks (divide & conquer) and merges results (`ForkJoinPool`).                    |
| **Parallel Streams**               | High-level API for parallel data processing using the Fork/Join framework internally.                         |
| **CompletableFuture**              | Asynchronous, non-blocking computations with chaining (`thenApply`, `thenCombine`).                           |
| **Concurrency Utilities**          | Classes in `java.util.concurrent`: `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`, `BlockingQueue`.           |

# ðŸ”¹ Quick Notes

* **Thread Safety**: Avoid race conditions using synchronization, locks, atomics.
* **Executors**: Prefer over manual `Thread` creation for better scalability.
* **Avoid Deadlocks**: Use consistent lock ordering, timeouts, or try-lock.
* **Best Practice**: Use high-level concurrency utilities (Executor, CompletableFuture) instead of low-level `wait/notify`.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also make a **thread lifecycle diagram** (showing transitions between states) so itâ€™s easier to visualize?
