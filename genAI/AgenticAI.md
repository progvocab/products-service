### **3. Core Concepts in Agentic AI Libraries**

#### **Perception**:
- Agents need to understand their environment through sensors (in physical robots) or simulated inputs (in virtual environments).
- Libraries often provide pre-built environments or APIs for integrating custom sensors.

#### **Decision Making**:
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A key technique used in many agentic AI libraries where agents learn by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Policy and Value Functions**: Core components of RL where the policy defines the agent’s behavior, and the value function estimates the expected rewards.

#### **Action**:
- Agents take actions based on their decision-making process. The success of these actions is evaluated to improve future decisions.

#### **Learning Paradigms**:
- **Supervised Learning**: Used in cases where labeled data is available.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns from the consequences of its actions.
- **Imitation Learning**: The agent learns by mimicking expert behavior.
