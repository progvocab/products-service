Functional programming in Java emphasizes using pure functions and immutable data to create more concise, readable, and maintainable code. Java 8 introduced features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces, making it easier to incorporate functional programming principles into Java code. [1, 2, 3]  
Key Concepts in Functional Programming: [1, 4]  

• Pure Functions: Functions that always return the same output for a given input and don't have side effects (e.g., modifying global variables or external state). [1, 4]  
• Immutability: Data that cannot be changed after it's created. [1, 4]  
• Higher-Order Functions: Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as values. [1, 5]  
• First-Class Functions: Functions that can be treated like any other data type (passed as arguments, returned from functions, etc.). [1, 5]  
• Function Composition: Combining multiple functions to create a new function. [1, 5]  

Benefits of Functional Programming in Java: [1, 2]  

• Conciseness and Readability: Functional code can be more compact and easier to understand due to the declarative style. 
• Improved Testability: Pure functions are easier to test because they don't rely on external state. 
• Reduced Bugs: Immutability and avoiding side effects can help prevent common programming errors. 
• Concurrency: Functional programming can be well-suited for concurrent and parallel programming due to its reliance on immutable data and pure functions. [1, 2]  

Java Features for Functional Programming: [3, 6]  

• Lambda Expressions: Concise, anonymous functions that can be used to implement functional interfaces. [3, 6]  
• Functional Interfaces: Interfaces with a single abstract method that can be used with lambda expressions. [3, 7]  
• Streams: A sequence of elements that support various functional operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing. [1, 2]  
• Optional: A container object that may or may not contain a value, helping to avoid null pointer exceptions. [1, 2]  

Example: 
// Imperative approach
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
for (int number : numbers) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        evenNumbers.add(number);
    }
}

// Functional approach using streams
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(number -> number % 2 == 0)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

Generative AI is experimental.
