Perfect 👍 — let’s build a **month-by-month roadmap** to go from *research idea → submission* for a **top-tier ML/AI conference** (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, SIGIR, RecSys).

I’ll assume:

* You are starting ~9 months before the deadline.
* You have **some idea space** (dataset, method, problem area).
* You want to maximize your chances of acceptance.

# 🗓️ Roadmap to Publishing in Top-tier Conferences

## 📍 Months 1–2: **Exploration & Idea Selection**

* **Survey literature**: Read last 2–3 years of papers at your target conference.
* **Identify gaps**: Look for limitations → scalability, generalization, interpretability, domain-specific failures.
* **Brainstorm multiple directions** (don’t lock in too early).
* **Validate novelty**: Use tools like **Connected Papers**, Google Scholar alerts, Semantic Scholar to ensure your idea isn’t already solved.
* **Write a 1–page pitch**:

  * Problem
  * Why it matters
  * What’s missing in current work
  * Your high-level approach

✅ Output: **Problem statement + hypothesis.**

---

## 📍 Months 3–4: **Prototype & Preliminary Results**

* **Build a simple baseline** → replicate existing methods (to ensure fair comparisons later).
* **Prototype your method** (even hacky).
* Run **small-scale experiments** on a subset of datasets.
* Collect **early results** → even if weak, check feasibility.
* **Decide conference target** → NeurIPS vs ICML vs ICLR vs KDD etc. (important for writing later).

✅ Output: **Evidence your idea works (even on toy examples).**

---

## 📍 Months 5–6: **Full Experiments & Theory**

* Scale up: Train on **multiple datasets** (3–5 is standard).
* Implement **ablations** → show why each component matters.
* Add **robustness tests**: different seeds, hyperparams, noise.
* (If theory-heavy): Work on **proofs, complexity analysis, or convergence guarantees.**
* Keep detailed logs for **reproducibility.**

✅ Output: **Strong experimental/theoretical backbone.**

---

## 📍 Month 7: **Writing (First Draft)**

* Use the **official LaTeX template** for the conference.
* Write **Introduction & Related Work** first.
* Then write **Method** (clear math, diagrams).
* Add **Experiments section** with tables, plots, ablations.
* Draft **Conclusion + Limitations** (reviewers like honesty).
* Maintain a **clear contributions box** (3–4 bullet points in intro).

✅ Output: **Complete draft (but rough).**

---

## 📍 Month 8: **Feedback & Refinement**

* Circulate draft in your lab / among colleagues.
* Present at an internal **reading group** → collect critical feedback.
* Revise experiments based on reviewer-like questions.
* Polish figures/tables for clarity.
* Add more related work if missing.
* Prepare **supplementary material** (proofs, extra results, hyperparameters).

✅ Output: **Polished draft + appendix.**

---

## 📍 Month 9: **Finalization & Submission**

* Double-check **conference formatting rules** (strict!).
* Complete **Reproducibility Checklist** (mandatory for NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).
* Ensure all references are up-to-date.
* Freeze experiments at least 1–2 weeks before deadline (avoid last-minute chaos).
* Proofread with tools like Grammarly + read aloud to catch awkward phrasing.
* Submit to **OpenReview** (ICLR) or conference submission portal (CMT, etc.).

✅ Output: **Submitted paper 🎉**

---

## 📍 After Submission (Optional but Smart)

* Post on **arXiv** (if allowed by conference).
* Share with the community (Twitter, LinkedIn, mailing lists).
* Prepare a **rebuttal plan** (if conference allows responses to reviews).
* Start planning **next iteration** — even rejected papers often become strong in the next cycle.

---

# 🎯 Key Survival Tips

* **Novelty + clarity** > fancy math with weak results.
* **Reproducibility is crucial** → reviewers hate vague methods.
* **Ablations are mandatory** → show why your choices matter.
* **Strong baselines** → don’t compare only against weak models.
* **Write early, revise often** → most papers fail due to poor writing.

✅ Following this 9-month roadmap gives you a **structured path** from idea to submission.

Would you like me to create a **sample timeline customized for NeurIPS 2026** (with exact months/dates for when to do each step, aligned with NeurIPS deadlines)?
