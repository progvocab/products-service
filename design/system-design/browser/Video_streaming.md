# Video Streaming

---

the browser **does use UDP as well** when communicating with YouTube (and many modern web apps), but **not for everything**. 

---

## **1. Default Web Traffic (HTTPS over TCP/TLS)**

* When you type `youtube.com` in your browser â†’ the initial page load (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, metadata) is done using **HTTP/HTTPS over TCP (TLS)**.
* This ensures **reliability, ordered delivery, and encryption**.

---

## **2. Video Streaming (UDP via QUIC/HTTP/3)**

* For video playback (the actual YouTube video stream):

  * YouTube uses **QUIC protocol**, which runs on **UDP**.
  * QUIC is the foundation of **HTTP/3** (the next-gen HTTP protocol).
* Why UDP/QUIC instead of TCP?

  * **Lower latency** (no TCP 3-way handshake, faster connection setup).
  * **Better congestion control** for streaming.
  * **Multiplexing** (multiple streams without head-of-line blocking).
  * Works well with **packet loss** (common in mobile/wifi networks).

## **3. Other UDP Uses in Browser**

* **DNS**: Traditional DNS lookups use UDP (port 53).
* **WebRTC (live streaming, video calls)**: Uses UDP for real-time communication.
* **DoH/DoQUIC (DNS over HTTPS/QUIC)**: DNS can even ride over UDP via QUIC.

### Communication

How a browser communicates with **YouTube.com** using both **TCP (HTTPS)** and **UDP (QUIC/HTTP/3)**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Browser["Browser (Client)"]
        A[User types youtube.com]
        B[Initial Page Request<br/> HTML, CSS, JS ]
        C[Video Playback Request]
    end

    subgraph Network["Network Layer"]
        D[DNS Lookup<br/> UDP 53 or DoH/DoQUIC ]
    end

    subgraph YouTube["YouTube Servers"]
        E[Web Server<br/> HTTPS over TCP/TLS ]
        F[Video Streaming Server<br/> QUIC/HTTP3 over UDP ]
    end

    A --> D
    D --> E
    B --> E
    E --> B

    C --> F
    F --> C
```

### ðŸ”Ž Explanation of Flow

1. **DNS Lookup** â†’ Browser queries DNS (UDP 53, or DNS-over-HTTPS/QUIC).
2. **Initial Page Load** â†’ Browser uses **TCP + TLS (HTTPS)** to fetch HTML, CSS, JS, thumbnails, ads, metadata.
3. **Video Streaming** â†’ Actual video is streamed via **QUIC (UDP, HTTP/3)** for lower latency and better performance.

## âœ… Summary

* **Browser â†’ YouTube HTML page** â†’ **TCP/TLS (HTTPS)**.
* **YouTube video stream itself** â†’ **UDP via QUIC/HTTP/3**.
* **Supporting protocols** (DNS, WebRTC if used) â†’ **UDP** too.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to **draw a Mermaid diagram** showing how a YouTube session looks (browser using both TCP and UDP paths)? That way you can see which parts go over TCP and which over UDP.
