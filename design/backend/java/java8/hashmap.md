### Hashmap internal working 

A HashMap stores key-value pairs using an array of buckets (bins) where each bucket can hold a linked list of nodes. When a key is added, its hashCode() method is used to calculate an index (bucket). If multiple keys hash to the same index (collision), they are stored in a linked list at that bucket. When retrieving a value, the process is reversed: the key's hashCode() is used to find the bucket, and then the equals() method is used to compare keys within that bucket. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Elaboration: [1, 2]  

 - Buckets/Bins: A HashMap uses an array of buckets, also known as bins, to store data. Each bucket can potentially hold multiple key-value pairs. [1, 2, 3]  
 - Nodes: Each key-value pair is stored in a Node object. These nodes are linked together within a bucket to handle potential collisions (two or more keys hashing to the same index). [1, 3, 4, 6]  
 - Hashing: The hashCode() method of the key is used to calculate an index (bucket) within the array. This index determines where the key-value pair will be stored. [3, 4]  
 - Collision Handling: If two keys have the same hashcode, they will be stored in the same bucket (collision). To resolve this, Java uses chaining, where a linked list is used to store multiple key-value pairs within the same bucket. [1, 4]  
 - Put Operation: When a key-value pair is added (put), the key's hashCode() is calculated to determine the bucket. If the bucket is empty, the new node is placed there. If the bucket is not empty (collision), the new node is added to the linked list in that bucket. [1, 3, 4]  
 - Get Operation: When a value is retrieved (get), the key's hashCode() is calculated to find the bucket. The equals() method is then used to compare the key with the keys stored in the linked list of that bucket to find the matching value. [3, 5]  
- Java 8 and beyond: In Java 8 and later, HashMap uses a combination of linked lists and red-black trees to handle collisions. When the number of nodes in a bucket exceeds a threshold, the linked list is converted to a red-black tree for better performance. [7]

In Java, the **time complexity of `HashMap`** operations depends on several factors like hashing quality and collisions. Here's the breakdown for `put()` and `get()`:

---

### **1. Average Case Time Complexity**

| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `put(K, V)` | **O(1)** | Hash the key, compute bucket index, and insert. If the bucket is free or has a short list, insertion is constant time. |
| `get(K)`    | **O(1)** | Hash the key and retrieve the value from the computed bucket index. |

This average-case performance assumes:
- Good hash function (distributes keys evenly).
- Few collisions.
- Small linked list/tree in each bucket.

---

### **2. Worst Case Time Complexity**

| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `put(K, V)` | **O(n)** | If all keys hash to the same bucket, insertion happens in a list of n elements. |
| `get(K)`    | **O(n)** | Full traversal of a bucket if collisions are severe. |

However, since Java 8, **buckets with many entries are converted into balanced trees** (red-black trees), reducing worst-case to **O(log n)**:

| Scenario | Worst-case with tree buckets |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `put(K, V)` | **O(log n)** |
| `get(K)`    | **O(log n)** |

The treeification happens when a bucket exceeds a threshold (default: 8 entries).

---

### **3. Rehashing Cost**

When the number of entries exceeds the `load factor * capacity`, the map resizes (rehashing), which is **O(n)** operation. But it happens infrequently and is amortized.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Case        | `put()` Time | `get()` Time |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Average     | O(1)         | O(1)         |
| Worst (list)| O(n)         | O(n)         |
| Worst (tree)| O(log n)     | O(log n)     |

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- Use high-quality hash codes to maintain constant time complexity.
- Choose initial capacity wisely to avoid frequent rehashing.
- Java’s internal treeification in HashMap reduces the impact of worst-case collisions.

Implementing a **Red-Black Tree (RBT)** from scratch can be complex due to rebalancing logic, but you can use simplified approaches to understand how it works—especially how it's used in Java's `HashMap`.

---

### **What is a Red-Black Tree?**

A **Red-Black Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree with the following properties:

1. Each node is red or black.
2. The root is always black.
3. Red nodes cannot have red children (no two reds in a row).
4. Every path from a node to its descendant `null` nodes has the same number of black nodes.
5. New insertions are red by default and may trigger rebalancing (rotations + recoloring).

---

### **Use in Java HashMap**

Since Java 8, when a hash bucket exceeds a threshold (default 8), it's converted into a Red-Black Tree to maintain **O(log n)** lookup and insert time.

---

### **Simple Red-Black Tree Implementation in Java (Simplified)**

Here's a basic sketch to insert nodes into a Red-Black Tree (for learning, not production use):

```java
enum Color { RED, BLACK }

class Node {
    int key;
    Color color;
    Node left, right, parent;

    Node(int key) {
        this.key = key;
        this.color = Color.RED; // New nodes are red by default
    }
}

public class RedBlackTree {
    private Node root;

    public void insert(int key) {
        Node node = new Node(key);
        root = bstInsert(root, node);
        fixViolation(node);
    }

    private Node bstInsert(Node root, Node node) {
        if (root == null) return node;
        if (node.key < root.key) {
            root.left = bstInsert(root.left, node);
            root.left.parent = root;
        } else {
            root.right = bstInsert(root.right, node);
            root.right.parent = root;
        }
        return root;
    }

    private void rotateLeft(Node node) {
        Node r = node.right;
        node.right = r.left;
        if (r.left != null) r.left.parent = node;
        r.parent = node.parent;
        if (node.parent == null) root = r;
        else if (node == node.parent.left) node.parent.left = r;
        else node.parent.right = r;
        r.left = node;
        node.parent = r;
    }

    private void rotateRight(Node node) {
        Node l = node.left;
        node.left = l.right;
        if (l.right != null) l.right.parent = node;
        l.parent = node.parent;
        if (node.parent == null) root = l;
        else if (node == node.parent.left) node.parent.left = l;
        else node.parent.right = l;
        l.right = node;
        node.parent = l;
    }

    private void fixViolation(Node node) {
        while (node != root && node.parent.color == Color.RED) {
            Node parent = node.parent;
            Node grandparent = parent.parent;
            if (parent == grandparent.left) {
                Node uncle = grandparent.right;
                if (uncle != null && uncle.color == Color.RED) {
                    // Case 1: Uncle is red
                    parent.color = Color.BLACK;
                    uncle.color = Color.BLACK;
                    grandparent.color = Color.RED;
                    node = grandparent;
                } else {
                    // Case 2 & 3: Uncle is black
                    if (node == parent.right) {
                        node = parent;
                        rotateLeft(node);
                    }
                    parent.color = Color.BLACK;
                    grandparent.color = Color.RED;
                    rotateRight(grandparent);
                }
            } else {
                // Mirror image of above
                Node uncle = grandparent.left;
                if (uncle != null && uncle.color == Color.RED) {
                    parent.color = Color.BLACK;
                    uncle.color = Color.BLACK;
                    grandparent.color = Color.RED;
                    node = grandparent;
                } else {
                    if (node == parent.left) {
                        node = parent;
                        rotateRight(node);
                    }
                    parent.color = Color.BLACK;
                    grandparent.color = Color.RED;
                    rotateLeft(grandparent);
                }
            }
        }
        root.color = Color.BLACK;
    }

    // Add inorder traversal to verify structure
    public void inorder(Node node) {
        if (node != null) {
            inorder(node.left);
            System.out.println(node.key + " (" + node.color + ")");
            inorder(node.right);
        }
    }

    public Node getRoot() {
        return root;
    }
}
```

### **How to Use**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RedBlackTree tree = new RedBlackTree();
        int[] keys = {10, 20, 30, 15, 25, 5};
        for (int key : keys) tree.insert(key);
        tree.inorder(tree.getRoot());
    }
}
```

---

### **Use Cases in Practice**

- Java `TreeMap` and `TreeSet` are full implementations of Red-Black Trees.
- Java `HashMap` converts a bucket to Red-Black Tree for performance when needed.
