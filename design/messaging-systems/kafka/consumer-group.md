Great question! Understanding **consumer groups** is key to building scalable, reliable Kafka applications.

## 🧠 What is a Kafka **Consumer Group**?

A **consumer group** is a **logical grouping of consumers** that work together to consume messages from a Kafka topic **in parallel**, with each message being processed **only once** by the group.

---

### 📊 Relationship Between:

#### 🔸 **Topics**, **Partitions**, and **Consumer Groups**

| Concept            | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Topic**          | A named feed to which producers publish and from which consumers read.    |
| **Partition**      | Topics are divided into partitions for parallelism and scalability.       |
| **Consumer Group** | A group of consumers that cooperatively read from the topic’s partitions. |

---

### 📦 How It Works

* Each partition is assigned to **only one consumer** in the group.
* Kafka ensures **load balancing**: multiple consumers in the same group divide the partitions.
* Each group **maintains its own offset**, so multiple groups can read the same topic independently.

---

### 🎯 Example

Let’s say:

* Topic `orders` has 3 partitions: `orders-0`, `orders-1`, `orders-2`.
* Consumer group `order-service` has 2 consumers: `C1` and `C2`.

> Kafka assigns:

* `C1`: `orders-0`, `orders-1`
* `C2`: `orders-2`

Every message is processed **once per group**, not per consumer.

## 🔧 Managing Consumer Groups (ZooKeeper CLI)

**⚠️ Note**: Managing consumer groups via ZooKeeper is **deprecated** and was only used in very old Kafka versions (< 0.10). Modern Kafka stores consumer offsets in Kafka itself (`__consumer_offsets` topic).

---

### 🛠️ If You're Using Very Old Kafka (ZooKeeper-based):

#### ✅ 1. Start ZooKeeper CLI

```bash
zkCli.sh -server localhost:2181
```

#### ✅ 2. List all consumer groups (ZooKeeper path)

```bash
ls /consumers
```

You’ll see:

```
[order-service, inventory-service, ...]
```

#### ✅ 3. List topic subscriptions of a group

```bash
ls /consumers/order-service/owners
```

Lists the topic partitions assigned to the group.

#### ✅ 4. View partition assignment

```bash
ls /consumers/order-service/owners/orders
```

Example output:

```
[0, 1, 2]
```

Each number is a partition. You can check who owns them.

---

### 🚫 Limitations of ZooKeeper-based Group Management

* Doesn't support **dynamic group membership**.
* Doesn't allow **offset commit management via Kafka APIs**.
* Difficult to **rebalance** or **reset offsets**.

---

## ✅ Modern Way (Kafka-managed Groups)

Use:

```bash
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

List topics, reset offsets, describe groups, etc.

Example:

```bash
# Describe group
kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --describe --group order-service

# Reset offset
kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group order-service \
  --topic orders \
  --reset-offsets --to-earliest --execute
```

## 🔁 Summary

| Concept             | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Consumer Group**  | Set of consumers that coordinate to consume a topic’s partitions         |
| **ZooKeeper Role**  | Used in older Kafka versions for tracking group metadata                 |
| **Modern Practice** | Kafka brokers manage groups via `__consumer_offsets`, ZooKeeper not used |
| **Management Tool** | `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` (not `zkCli.sh`)                              |

---

Let me know your Kafka version — if you're using Kafka 2.0+ or 3.x, you should **avoid managing consumer groups via ZooKeeper** and use Kafka CLI tools instead.
