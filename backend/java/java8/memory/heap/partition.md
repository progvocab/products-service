Excellent question 🙌 — you’re basically asking: **how does the JVM partition the heap, and along which dimensions (mobility, size, space, kind, yield, locality, thread)?**

Let’s go step by step.

# 🔹 Heap Partitioning in JVM

The **JVM heap** is divided into regions based on **object lifecycle, size, and garbage collection strategies**.
The exact structure depends on the **GC algorithm** used (e.g., Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah).

---

## 1. By **Mobility**

* **Movable objects:** Most objects can be moved around during **compacting GCs** to reduce fragmentation.
* **Non-movable objects:** Large objects or pinned objects (e.g., direct buffers, JNI-allocated memory) often go into special areas (like **humongous regions** in G1).

👉 So yes, heap is partly partitioned by mobility.

---

## 2. By **Size**

* **Young Generation (Eden + Survivor):** For small, short-lived objects.
* **Old Generation (Tenured):** For larger, long-lived objects.
* **Large/Humongous Objects:** Stored directly in old gen (or special regions).

👉 Definitely partitioned by size.

---

## 3. By **Space (Lifecycle)**

* **Eden Space:** New objects created here.
* **Survivor Spaces (S0, S1):** Objects surviving minor collections get copied back and forth.
* **Old/Tenured Space:** Long-lived objects promoted here.
* **Metaspace (outside heap):** Stores class metadata (used to be PermGen before Java 8).

👉 Yes, the main partitioning is Eden → Survivor → Old.

---

## 4. By **Kind**

* Some collectors (like **G1**) divide heap into many small **regions** (1–32 MB each), which can be dynamically treated as Eden, Survivor, or Old.
* Special kinds of spaces exist:

  * **Code Cache** (for JIT-compiled code, not in heap but managed by JVM).
  * **Compressed OOPs space** (for 32-bit references on 64-bit JVM).

👉 So yes, partitioned by kind.

---

## 5. By **Yield (Allocation Rate / GC Goal)**

* Different collectors optimize for different **throughput vs latency trade-offs**.
* Example:

  * **Parallel GC:** Maximizes throughput (fast yield).
  * **G1, ZGC, Shenandoah:** Optimize for low latency.
* Heap partitioning (region size, promotion thresholds, etc.) depends on these goals.

👉 Indirectly partitioned by yield.

---

## 6. By **Locality**

* G1, ZGC, and Shenandoah try to **improve locality of reference** by grouping related objects into the same regions.
* Locality is important for CPU cache efficiency.
* Thread-local allocations (see below) also improve locality.

👉 Yes, partitioning considers locality.

---

## 7. By **Thread**

* JVM uses **Thread-Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs)** inside the Eden space.
* Each thread gets its own **chunk of heap** to allocate small objects **without synchronization**.
* This reduces contention and improves speed.

👉 Yes, heap is partitioned per-thread using TLABs.

# 🔹 Diagram (Simplified)

```
Heap
 ├── Young Generation
 │    ├── Eden (with TLABs per thread)
 │    └── Survivor (S0, S1)
 ├── Old Generation
 │    ├── Long-lived objects
 │    └── Humongous objects (if G1)
 └── Special spaces
      ├── Code Cache (JIT)
      └── Metaspace (class metadata)
```

---

# ✅ Final Answer

Yes — the **JVM partitions the heap along several dimensions**:

* **Mobility:** movable vs pinned objects.
* **Size:** small (young gen) vs large (humongous).
* **Space/Lifecycle:** Eden, Survivor, Old.
* **Kind:** generational regions, code cache, metaspace.
* **Yield (GC goal):** throughput vs latency collectors optimize differently.
* **Locality:** objects grouped to improve cache efficiency.
* **Thread:** per-thread TLABs for fast allocation.

👉 Would you like me to **draw a full detailed diagram** of heap partitioning (TLABs, regions, old gen, metaspace, etc.) for modern JVMs like **G1 GC**?
Perfect 👍 — let’s draw a **detailed JVM heap partitioning diagram** for a **modern collector like G1 GC** (since G1 is the default in Java 9+).

   Legend:
   - Eden: new allocations (thread-local via TLABs).
   - Survivor 0 / Survivor 1: objects surviving GC copied between them.
   - Old: promoted long-lived objects.
   - Humongous: very large objects directly stored in Old Gen.

# 🔹 How Partitioning Works

1. **Eden Space**

   * Fresh allocations (via **TLABs** per thread).
   * Fast bump-pointer allocation (no locking).

2. **Survivor Spaces (S0, S1)**

   * Objects that survive GC are copied between survivor spaces.
   * Eventually promoted to Old Gen.

3. **Old Generation**

   * Holds objects that survived many collections.
   * **Humongous objects** (size ≥ 50% of a region) go directly here.

4. **Metaspace (outside heap)**

   * Stores class metadata, method info, constant pools.

5. **Code Cache**

   * Stores JIT-compiled native code.

6. **Thread-Local Areas**

   * Each thread gets **TLAB** (Thread Local Allocation Buffer) in Eden for fast allocation.
   * Each thread also has its own **stack** (not part of heap).

---

✅ **Summary:**
Yes — the JVM partitions the heap **by mobility, size, space, kind, yield, locality, and thread**. In **G1 GC**, the heap is divided into small regions, dynamically assigned as Eden, Survivor, Old, or Humongous, with per-thread TLABs for efficiency.

---

👉 Do you also want me to **map these partitions to GC events** (e.g., what happens during a **minor GC** vs a **major GC** step by step)?
