Cloud-native solutions for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** help automate and manage cloud resources efficiently. Here are some key tools and platforms:

### **1. Declarative IaC Tools**
- **Terraform** (by HashiCorp): Cloud-agnostic, supports multiple providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
- **Pulumi**: Uses real programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go) instead of domain-specific languages.
- **Crossplane**: Kubernetes-native IaC, extending Kubernetes API for cloud resources.

### **2. Kubernetes-Centric IaC**
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes applications.
- **Kustomize**: Kubernetes-native way to manage configurations.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based continuous deployment for Kubernetes.
- **FluxCD**: GitOps tool for automating Kubernetes deployments.

### **3. Cloud Provider-Specific IaC**
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-native declarative infrastructure management.
- **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: IaC using real programming languages for AWS.
- **Azure Bicep**: Declarative IaC language for Azure, an alternative to ARM templates.
- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: Google Cloudâ€™s native IaC tool.

### **4. GitOps & CI/CD for IaC**
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates Terraform, Pulumi, or Kubernetes workflows.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Supports IaC automation and GitOps pipelines.
- **Spinnaker**: Multi-cloud continuous delivery for infrastructure and applications.

### **5. Policy & Security as Code**
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)**: Kubernetes-native policy enforcement.
- **HashiCorp Sentinel**: Policy-as-code framework for Terraform.
- **Checkov**: Static code analysis for IaC security.
