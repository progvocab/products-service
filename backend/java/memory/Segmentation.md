## **Segmentation**

* **Definition:** A **memory management technique** where a programâ€™s memory is divided into **variable-sized logical segments**, such as:

  * **Code segment** (instructions)
  * **Data segment** (global/static variables)
  * **Stack segment** (function calls, local variables)
  * **Heap segment** (dynamically allocated memory)

* Each segment is identified by a **segment number + offset**.

* Segments are **not equal in size**; they reflect the logical structure of the program.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

```
Process A:
  Code -> 8 KB
  Data -> 4 KB
  Stack -> 2 KB
```

The OS keeps a **segment table** with base & limit addresses for each segment.

**Advantages:**

* Matches programâ€™s logical structure.
* Easier protection (code can be read-only, stack can be growable).
* Supports sharing (two processes can share a code segment).

**Disadvantages:**

* External fragmentation can occur (because segments vary in size).
* More complex address translation.

## **Partitioning**

* **Definition:** Dividing **physical memory** into **fixed-size or variable-size partitions**. Each partition can hold exactly one process.
* Used in early OS designs for multiprogramming.

### Types:

1. **Fixed Partitioning**

   * Memory is divided into equal (or predefined) sized partitions.
   * Each process fits into one partition.
   * Wastage: **Internal fragmentation** (unused space inside partition).

2. **Dynamic (Variable) Partitioning**

   * Partitions are created dynamically to fit the process size.
   * Wastage: **External fragmentation** (free memory scattered in small blocks).

ðŸ“Œ Example:

```
Physical Memory:
[Partition 1: 16KB][Partition 2: 16KB][Partition 3: 16KB][Partition 4: 16KB]
```

Each partition holds one process.

## **Key Differences**

| Aspect            | **Segmentation**                                        | **Partitioning**                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Division**      | Divides **logical memory** (code, data, stack, heap)    | Divides **physical memory** into partitions                    |
| **Size**          | Variable-sized, based on program structure              | Fixed-size (static) or variable (dynamic)                      |
| **Fragmentation** | External fragmentation                                  | Fixed: internal fragmentation, Dynamic: external fragmentation |
| **Mapping**       | Uses **segment table** (segment number + offset)        | Uses **partition table** (base + limit per partition)          |
| **View**          | Program-centric (logical units)                         | OS-centric (resource allocation)                               |
| **Sharing**       | Supports segment-level sharing (e.g., shared libraries) | No direct sharing, partitions are isolated                     |

âœ… **In short:**

* **Segmentation** = logical division of a process into variable-sized segments (code, data, stack).
* **Partitioning** = physical division of memory into partitions (fixed or dynamic) for process allocation.
