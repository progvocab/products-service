| Area                                                  | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Distributed Data Storage**                       | How data is stored and replicated across multiple nodes (e.g., HDFS, Cassandra, DynamoDB)         |
| **2. Consistency Models**                             | Defines how up-to-date and synchronized data is across nodes (e.g., Strong, Eventual, Causal)     |
| **3. Consensus & Coordination**                       | How nodes agree on a shared state (e.g., Paxos, Raft, Zookeeper, etcd)                            |
| **4. Partitioning / Sharding**                        | Splitting data or workload across machines for scalability                                        |
| **5. Replication**                                    | Copying data across nodes for fault tolerance (Leader-Follower, Quorum-based, Multi-Master)       |
| **6. Fault Tolerance & Recovery**                     | Ensuring system availability despite hardware/software failures                                   |
| **7. Service Discovery**                              | Allowing distributed nodes to find and communicate with each other (e.g., Consul, Eureka)         |
| **8. Load Balancing**                                 | Evenly distributing requests or data across servers                                               |
| **9. Distributed Caching**                            | Reducing latency by placing frequently accessed data closer to the user (e.g., Redis, Memcached)  |
| **10. Messaging Systems / Event-Driven Architecture** | Async communication via pub/sub, queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)                              |
| **11. Distributed Transactions / Sagas**              | Ensuring atomicity and consistency across multiple services or databases                          |
| **12. Monitoring & Observability**                    | Capturing metrics, logs, traces to understand system behavior (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger) |
| **13. Time & Clock Synchronization**                  | Handling time drift and ordering events (e.g., NTP, Lamport Clocks, Vector Clocks)                |
| **14. CAP and PACELC Theorems**                       | Fundamental trade-offs in availability, consistency, and latency                                  |
| **15. Distributed File Systems**                      | Managing file storage over networked machines (e.g., HDFS, Ceph, GlusterFS)                       |
| **16. Distributed Job Scheduling**                    | Coordinating distributed task execution (e.g., Kubernetes Jobs, Apache Airflow, Nomad)            |

| **Client-Server**                  | Clients make requests to centralized services                                    |
| **Event-Driven (EDA)**             | Services communicate via events (decoupled)                                      |
