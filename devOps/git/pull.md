Great question! Understanding how `git pull` behaves with **rebase**, **merge**, and **fast-forward** is crucial for maintaining a clean Git history.

---

### **1. `git pull` Recap**
`git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge` (by default)  
But you can customize its behavior using:
- `--rebase=true`
- `--rebase=false`
- `--ff-only` (fast-forward only)

---

### **2. `--rebase=true` (or `git pull --rebase`)**
- Instead of merging your local commits with fetched ones, **your local changes are temporarily removed**, the remote changes are applied, then **your changes are replayed on top** (rebased).
- This gives a **linear, cleaner history**.

**Example:**
```bash
git pull --rebase
```

**Before:**
```
A---B (origin/main)
     \
      C---D (main)
```

**After rebase:**
```
A---B---C'---D' (main)
```

**Pros:**
- Clean, linear history
- Avoids unnecessary merge commits

**Cons:**
- Rewriting history (so avoid on shared branches unless you're careful)

---

### **3. `--rebase=false` (default behavior)**
- This is the **default behavior** if not set otherwise.
- `git pull` will perform a **merge**, creating a **merge commit**.

**Example:**
```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```

**Result:**
```
A---B---M (main)
     \ /
      C---D
```
- `M` is the **merge commit**.

**Pros:**
- Easier to trace how branches were merged
- Good for teamwork visibility

**Cons:**
- Messier history with extra merge commits

---

### **4. `--ff-only` (fast-forward only)**
- Git will **only update** your branch if it can do a **fast-forward merge**, i.e., **no new local commits**.

**Example:**
```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

- If there's divergence, Git will **refuse to merge** and ask you to handle it explicitly.

**Pros:**
- Ensures linear history
- Avoids automatic merges

**Cons:**
- Requires local branch to be strictly behind remote

---

### Summary Table

| Option           | Behavior                      | History         | Use Case                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--rebase=true`  | Rebase local on remote        | Linear           | Clean history, personal branches       |
| `--rebase=false` | Merge remote into local       | Merge commits    | Default, collaborative workflows       |
| `--ff-only`      | Only fast-forward if possible | Linear only      | CI/CD, production branches             |

Let me know if you want a visual Git example or to simulate this with a repo!



If you want to **force your local branch to exactly match the remote branch** (i.e., ignore local commits and make it identical to `origin/branch`), you can **reset** your branch hard to the remote state.

---

### **Option 1: Discard Local Commits, Match Remote**
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/your-branch
```

- This **removes all local changes and commits** that aren't on the remote.
- Your local branch will now be identical to `origin/your-branch`.

> **WARNING**: Any local commits **not pushed** to the remote will be permanently lost.

---

### **Option 2: Force Remote to Match Local**  
(If you want to **discard remote changes** and push your local version)

```bash
git push origin your-branch --force
```

- This is the opposite: it **overwrites the remote** with your local commits.
- Only do this if you're sure it's safe and allowed by policy.

---

### Optional: Check What's Different
Before resetting, you might want to check the difference:
```bash
git log HEAD..origin/your-branch --oneline    # what's new in remote
git log origin/your-branch..HEAD --oneline    # what's new locally
```

---

Let me know which direction you're syncing (remote-to-local or local-to-remote), and I can help with the exact commands or safeguards.



Got it! You want to:

- **Keep your uncommitted local changes (unstaged/staged changes)**
- **Discard local commits**
- **Sync your branch’s committed state to match remote (e.g., `origin/master`)**
- **Revert any conflicting or diverging files to match remote**
  
This is a perfect use case for a **soft reset** or **checkout-based selective reset**.

---

### **Option 1: Soft Reset to Remote, Keep Uncommitted Changes**

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --soft origin/master
```

- Keeps **uncommitted changes** (files in your working directory).
- Removes local commits so you can **recommit** or discard selectively.
- Index and working directory remain unchanged.

> Any files modified in conflicting commits will show up as changes.

---

### **Option 2: Hard Reset Commits, But Stash & Restore Uncommitted Changes**

```bash
git stash push -m "temp changes"
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
git stash pop
```

- Temporarily stashes your uncommitted work.
- Resets your branch to match `origin/master`.
- Restores your local uncommitted work afterward.

> This will keep only your uncommitted changes and the rest exactly as in remote.

---

### **Option 3: Restore Specific Files to Match Remote**
If you want to **reset only files that are causing conflicts**, use:

```bash
git fetch origin
git restore --source origin/master path/to/file1 path/to/file2
```

This reverts selected files to their state in `origin/master` while leaving the rest untouched.

---

Let me know if you’re working on a branch other than master, or if you’d like a visual workflow.


If you want to:

- **Ignore (discard) all modified files**
- **Keep only the new/untracked files**
  
Here’s how to do it cleanly:

---

### **Discard All Modified Files (But Keep Untracked/New Files)**

```bash
git restore .
```

This will revert all **modified files** in the working directory to the last committed version, but it **does not touch new/untracked files**.

---

### **Alternative: Discard All Changes Except New Files**

```bash
git reset --hard   # Discards commits and modified files (doesn't affect untracked)
git clean -fd      # WARNING: This deletes untracked (new) files and dirs
```

If you want to **keep new files**, skip `git clean`.

---

### To See What Will Be Kept

Before running any command, check the status:

```bash
git status
```

- Modified files will be discarded with `git restore .`
- Untracked (new) files will stay

---

Let me know if you also want to move those new files to staging or a specific directory for backup.
