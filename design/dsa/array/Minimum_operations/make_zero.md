  about **LeetCode 1658: Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero**.

---

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`.
In one operation, you must **remove the leftmost or rightmost element** from `nums` and subtract its value from `x`.

Return the **minimum number of operations** to reduce `x` to exactly `0`.
If it’s not possible, return `-1`.

---

## Key Insight

Instead of thinking about subtracting numbers from `x`,
think of **keeping a subarray whose sum is equal to `totalSum - x`**:

* `totalSum = sum(nums)`
* Let `target = totalSum - x`
* We need the **longest subarray** with sum = `target`.
* Then the minimum operations = `n - lengthOfLongestSubarray`.

Why?
Because if the remaining subarray has sum = `target`, removing the other elements (from left/right) sums exactly to `x`.

---

## Algorithm (Sliding Window)

1. Compute `totalSum = sum(nums)`
2. Compute `target = totalSum - x`

   * If `target < 0`, return `-1` (not possible).
   * If `target == 0`, return `n` (remove all elements).
3. Use sliding window to find longest subarray with sum = `target`.
4. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.
5. Else, return `n - longestLength`.

---

## Python Solution

```python
def minOperations(nums, x):
    total = sum(nums)
    target = total - x
    if target < 0:
        return -1
    if target == 0:
        return len(nums)

    n = len(nums)
    left = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    max_len = -1

    for right in range(n):
        curr_sum += nums[right]
        
        while curr_sum > target and left <= right:
            curr_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        if curr_sum == target:
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return n - max_len if max_len != -1 else -1
```

---

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
total = 11
target = 11 - 5 = 6
Longest subarray with sum=6 → [1,4,1] (length 3)
Answer = n - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2
```

✅ Matches expected output.

---

## Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n)` (single sliding window)
* **Space:** `O(1)`

---

Do you want me to also show a **BFS/DFS brute-force approach** (like picking from left/right) so you can compare why sliding window is optimal?

# 📘 Problem: Reduce Array Elements to Zero

You are given an array `arr`.
In one operation, you can **choose any positive integer `x`** and subtract it from **all elements greater than 0**.
Find the **minimum number of operations** required to make all elements equal to `0`.

---

## 🔹 Key Insight

* Each operation subtracts the **same positive integer** from all positive elements.
* The only numbers that matter are the **distinct positive values** in the array.
* Because in each operation, at least one distinct value disappears.

👉 Therefore:

$$
\text{Minimum operations} = \text{Number of distinct positive elements}
$$

---

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
arr = [1, 5, 0, 3, 5]
Distinct positive values = {1, 3, 5}
Answer = 3
```

**Steps:**

* Subtract 1 → arr becomes \[0, 4, 0, 2, 4]
* Subtract 2 → arr becomes \[0, 2, 0, 0, 2]
* Subtract 2 → arr becomes \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3 operations ✅

---

### Example 2

```
arr = [0, 0, 0]
Distinct positive values = {}
Answer = 0
```

---

## 🔹 Python Solution

```python
def min_operations_reduce_to_zero(arr):
    # use a set to collect unique positive elements
    distinct_positive = {x for x in arr if x > 0}
    return len(distinct_positive)
```

---

## 🔹 Test

```python
print(min_operations_reduce_to_zero([1, 5, 0, 3, 5]))  # 3
print(min_operations_reduce_to_zero([0, 0, 0]))        # 0
print(min_operations_reduce_to_zero([4, 4, 4]))        # 1
print(min_operations_reduce_to_zero([2, 3, 6]))        # 3
```

---

✅ **Time Complexity** = $O(n)$
✅ **Space Complexity** = $O(n)$ (due to set)

👉 Do you also want me to extend this with a **step-by-step simulation function** (that prints the array after each operation), so you can visualize the process?
