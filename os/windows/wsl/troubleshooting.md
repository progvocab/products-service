To SSH into your WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instance from your MacBook Air, you need to ensure the following are configured correctly. Here's a step-by-step troubleshooting guide to help identify and fix the root cause:

---

### **1. Get WSL IP Address**

WSL doesn't bind directly to your Windows IP. Instead, it uses a virtual network interface. Run this in WSL:

```bash
ip addr | grep inet
```

Or:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Note down the IP (e.g., `172.x.x.x`).

---

### **2. Install & Start OpenSSH Server in WSL**

Make sure the SSH server is installed and running in your WSL instance:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo service ssh start
```

You may also check status:

```bash
sudo service ssh status
```

Ensure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` allows password login or key login.

---

### **3. Allow Port 22 in Windows Firewall**

You need to open port 22 on Windows:

- Go to **Windows Defender Firewall** > **Advanced Settings**
- Add **Inbound Rule**:
  - **Port:** 22
  - **Allow the connection**
  - **Public/Private**
  - **Name:** `WSL SSH`

---

### **4. Forward Port from Windows to WSL**

Windows doesn’t route traffic to WSL by default. You can use `netsh` to forward traffic from Windows port 2222 to WSL’s port 22:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=22 connectaddress=<WSL-IP>
```

Example:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2222 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=22 connectaddress=172.28.28.131
```

Also allow port `2222` through Windows Firewall.

---

### **5. SSH From Mac**

Now from your Mac, connect using:

```bash
ssh <wsl-username>@<windows-ip> -p 2222
```

You can get the Windows IP via `ipconfig` on CMD or PowerShell.

---

### **6. Check Common Issues**

- **SSH not starting:** Check logs in WSL: `sudo journalctl -u ssh` or `sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log`
- **Firewall blocking:** Temporarily disable firewall to test.
- **Wrong port/IP:** Ensure you are connecting to Windows IP on port 2222 (or 22 if directly mapped).
- **Key authentication fails:** Ensure your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is set correctly with the right permissions.

---

Would you like a script to auto-start and configure port forwarding each time WSL boots?

Thanks — this is a key clue. If **ping from Mac to Windows times out**, but **Windows to Mac works**, it suggests:

### **Root Cause: Windows Firewall or Network Profile Blocking Inbound Connections**

By default, **Windows blocks inbound ICMP (ping) and potentially other traffic** from external devices, especially if:

- You're on a **Public network profile**
- The **firewall doesn't allow** traffic from other devices on the LAN

---

### **Step-by-Step Fix**

#### **1. Change Network Profile to Private**

- Open **Settings > Network & Internet > Ethernet / Wi-Fi**
- Click the connected network
- Set **Network Profile** to **Private**

This allows Windows to trust the network and accept LAN traffic.

---

#### **2. Allow ICMP (Ping) in Windows Firewall**

To test connectivity with ping, allow ICMP traffic:

- Open **Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings**
- Go to **Inbound Rules**
- Find **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)**
- **Enable** it (green check)

Or enable it via PowerShell:

```powershell
Enable-NetFirewallRule -Name FPS-ICMP4-*
```

---

#### **3. Confirm Port Forwarding and SSH Inbound Rule (as described earlier)**

Even after ping works, **SSH** needs:

- Port 2222 (or your choice) **allowed** in firewall
- Port **forwarded to WSL**
- SSH **server running inside WSL**

---

#### **4. Retry SSH from Mac**

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<windows-ip> -p 2222
```

---

Let me know once ping works — then we can confirm SSH access too. If you'd like, I can give you a script or one-liner to automate these firewall and port proxy settings.


Thanks for the update! Since you can SSH into WSL from your **Windows machine**, but **not from other devices** like your **MacBook**, the issue is likely one of **network accessibility or firewall settings on Windows**. Let's narrow it down:

---

### **Checklist to Allow External SSH Access into WSL**

#### **1. Use Windows IP (Not WSL IP)**
From your MacBook, SSH to your Windows machine's IP address (found via `ipconfig` on Windows), using the forwarded port (e.g., `2222`):

```bash
ssh <username>@<windows-ip> -p 2222
```

Example:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.100 -p 2222
```

Do **not** use the WSL IP directly from your Mac — it's not reachable externally.

---

#### **2. Verify Windows Firewall Rules**
Even if it works locally, Windows may block **external access** to that port.

- Open **Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings**
- Go to **Inbound Rules**
  - Look for a rule allowing **TCP port 2222** (or 22 if you're forwarding that)
  - Ensure **Scope** allows connections from **any IP** (not just local subnet)
- If needed, create a **new rule**:
  - Port: `2222`
  - Allow connection
  - Profile: **All** (Domain, Private, Public)
  - Name: `SSH for WSL`

---

#### **3. Confirm Port Forwarding Is Set Up**
Ensure you're forwarding Windows port `2222` to WSL port `22` using:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

If not there, run:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2222 connectaddress=<WSL-IP> connectport=22
```

Also, run:

```powershell
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WSL SSH Port 2222" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=2222
```

---

#### **4. Confirm SSH Server Is Running in WSL**
Run this inside WSL:

```bash
sudo service ssh status
```

And check if port `22` is listening:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :22
```

---

#### **5. Temporarily Disable Firewall (for testing)**
Just for quick testing, try:

```powershell
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```

Then try connecting from Mac again. If it works, the issue is 100% firewall-related.

**Don't forget to turn it back on:**

```powershell
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
```

---

#### **6. Ensure Your Mac and Windows Are on Same Network**
- Same Wi-Fi or subnet
- No VPNs or guest networks separating them
- Ping test: `ping <windows-ip>` from Mac
