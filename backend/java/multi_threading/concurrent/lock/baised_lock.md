## **1. Fair Lock**
  A lock that grants access to threads **in the order they requested it** (FIFO).

* **Characteristics:**

  * Threads are queued in **arrival order**.
  * Prevents **starvation** (every thread eventually gets the lock).
  * **Slower** than unfair locks because it requires queue management.

* **Example in Java:**

```java
ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // true = fair
```

* **Use Case:**

  * When fairness is critical, e.g., **thread scheduling fairness in server apps**.

---

## **2. Biased Lock**

 A JVM optimization where a lock is **“biased” toward the first thread that acquires it**, assuming **no contention**.

* **Characteristics:**

  * If the same thread tries to acquire the lock repeatedly, it **avoids expensive atomic operations**.
  * **No queueing overhead** → much faster than fair locks under low contention.
  * If another thread tries to acquire the lock → JVM revokes the bias and upgrades to a **normal or lightweight lock**.

* **Use Case:**

  * Optimizes performance for **uncontended locks**, which are extremely common in typical Java apps.

| Feature       | Fair Lock                   | Biased Lock                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Thread Access | FIFO order, fair            | Biased toward first thread            |
| Overhead      | Higher (queue management)   | Very low if uncontended               |
| Contention    | Works well under contention | Must revoke bias if contention occurs |
| Use Case      | Fair scheduling required    | Optimizing uncontended locks          |
| Example       | `new ReentrantLock(true)`   | JVM default lock (biased enabled)     |

* **Fair Lock = fairness guaranteed, slower**.
* **Biased Lock = fast for single-threaded access, low overhead, bias revoked under contention**.

# 1️⃣ What is Biased Locking?

**Biased locking** is an optimization in the HotSpot JVM to make **synchronized blocks faster** when **only a single thread repeatedly acquires a lock**.

* In normal locking (lightweight or heavyweight), acquiring a lock involves **CAS operations** or even kernel calls.
* Biased locking **removes CAS overhead** if no contention exists.

---

# 2️⃣ Role of the **Biased Lock Flag** in Mark Word

* Every Java object has a **mark word** (object header).
* Part of this mark word stores the **lock state**, including a **biased lock bit**.
* **Biased Lock Flag = 1** → object is **biased toward a specific thread**.

---

# 3️⃣ How Biased Lock Works

1. Thread **A** enters a synchronized block on an object.
2. JVM sets **biased lock bit = 1** and stores **thread A’s ID** in the mark word.
3. Later, **thread A** can re-enter synchronized blocks on the same object **without CAS or contention checks**.
4. Only when **another thread (B)** tries to acquire the lock does JVM revoke bias and upgrade to **lightweight or heavyweight lock**.

# 4️⃣ Mark Word Layout (64-bit JVM, simplified)

| Bits                  | Meaning                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Biased Lock Flag (1)  | 1 = biased, 0 = not biased   |
| Lock Bits (2)         | 01 = unlocked / biased       |
| Thread ID             | ID of thread owning the bias |
| GC Age / Hash / other | Remaining bits               |

* The **biased lock flag** tells JVM:

  > “This lock is biased toward a single thread. Skip CAS if the same thread requests it.”

# 5️⃣ Advantages of Biased Lock

| Feature      | Benefit                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Low overhead | Single-thread lock acquisition avoids CAS entirely |
| Performance  | Speeds up uncontended synchronization              |
| Memory       | No extra objects needed for lock state             |

---

# 6️⃣ When Biased Locking is Revoked

* Another thread tries to acquire the lock → JVM **revokes bias**.
* Lock is upgraded to **lightweight or heavyweight** depending on contention.
* The original thread can still acquire lock normally afterward.

---

# 7️⃣ Summary

* **Biased Lock Flag** = optimization indicator in mark word.
* **Purpose:** Skip CAS for locks repeatedly acquired by a single thread.
* Reduces CPU overhead for uncontended locks.
* Automatically revoked if multiple threads contend.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing the mark word with biased lock, thread ID, and how the lock transitions when another thread tries to acquire it**, which makes it very visual.

Do you want me to do that?
