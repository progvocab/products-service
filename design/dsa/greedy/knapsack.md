A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a globally optimal solution. One common example is the fractional knapsack problem, where you aim to maximize the value of items placed in a knapsack with a limited weight capacity. [1, 2, 3]  
Here's a more detailed explanation with an example: 
Problem: You have a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value. Your goal is to fill the knapsack with items to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit. [2, 3, 4, 5]  
Greedy Approach: 

1. Calculate Value-to-Weight Ratio: For each item, calculate its value divided by its weight. This represents the value you get for each unit of weight. [2, 3, 6, 7]  
2. Sort by Ratio: Sort the items in descending order of their value-to-weight ratio. [8]  
3. Fill the Knapsack: 
	• Start with the item with the highest ratio and add it to the knapsack if it can fit without exceeding the weight limit. [3]  
	• If the item is too heavy, take a fraction of it to fill the remaining capacity. [2, 3]  
	• Repeat this process for the remaining items, always choosing the item with the highest ratio that can fit. [2, 3]  

Example: 
Let's say you have: 

• Knapsack capacity: 50 [9, 10]  
• Items: 
	• Item A: Weight 10, Value 60 [11, 12, 13, 14]  
	• Item B: Weight 20, Value 100 [15, 16]  
	• Item C: Weight 30, Value 120 [16, 17]  

Calculations: 

• Ratio of Item A: 60/10 = 6 
• Ratio of Item B: 100/20 = 5 
• Ratio of Item C: 120/30 = 4 [18, 19, 20, 21]  

Greedy Steps: 

1. Sort by Ratio: Item A (6) -&gt; Item B (5) -&gt; Item C (4) 
2. Fill Knapsack: 
	• Item A: 10 kg fits. Knapsack remaining capacity: 50 - 10 = 40. [20, 21]  
	• Item B: 20 kg fits. Knapsack remaining capacity: 40 - 20 = 20. [22, 23]  
	• Item C: 30 kg does not fit. We take 2/3 of Item C (20 kg) -&gt; 20/30 = 2/3 
	• Knapsack filled with Item A, Item B, and 2/3 of Item C. 

3. Total Value: 60 + 100 + (2/3 * 120) = 240 [24]  

Outcome: The greedy algorithm fills the knapsack with items A, B, and 2/3 of item C, resulting in a total value of 240. [2, 3]  
Important Note: The fractional knapsack problem is a good example of where a greedy algorithm guarantees the optimal solution. Not all problems can be solved optimally with a greedy approach. [1, 2, 3, 25]
