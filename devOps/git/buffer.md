The Git configuration option `http.postBuffer` controls the **maximum size of a single HTTP POST request buffer** when communicating with a remote repository over HTTP(S).

---

### **What It Does**

* Git uses HTTP(S) to transfer data to/from remotes.
* During a `push`, Git may try to send large objects (commits, blobs, trees).
* If the buffer is too small, the push might fail with errors like:

  * `RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 413`
  * `The remote end hung up unexpectedly`

---

### **Default Value**

```bash
git config --get http.postBuffer
```

* Default is **1 MB** (1,048,576 bytes).

---

### **When to Increase It**

You might increase it to avoid push errors with large files or large commit histories.

### **Command to Increase It**

```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```

This sets it to **500 MB**.

---

### **Use Case**

Useful when:

* Pushing large files or large repositories.
* Working behind proxies or firewalls that limit POST sizes.
