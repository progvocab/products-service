Perfect follow-up ✅ — in **agent configuration**, “**prompts**” are just as important as **runtime type** and **LLM settings (MCPs)**. Let’s go step by step.

## 🔹 What are Prompts?

A **prompt** is the *instruction or context* you give to the LLM so it behaves the way you want.
In agent configuration, prompts define the **personality, role, task instructions, and context rules** that guide the agent’s reasoning.

## 🔹 Types of Prompts in Agent Configuration

1. **System Prompt**

   * Defines the **role, personality, and rules** for the agent.
   * Example:

     > "You are a financial assistant that explains investment risks in simple language. Always provide clear disclaimers."

2. **User Prompt**

   * Direct request from the end-user.
   * Example:

     > "Summarize this earnings report in 3 bullet points."

3. **Context Prompt (Knowledge Injection)**

   * Adds **retrieved data** or **domain-specific facts** (from RAG, database, or memory).
   * Example:

     > "Company X reported Q2 revenue of \$4.5B, up 12% YoY."

4. **Instruction Prompt (Task Control)**

   * Tells the agent **how** to process the input.
   * Example:

     > "Generate an SQL query using only the `employees` and `departments` tables."

5. **Chain-of-Thought / Reasoning Prompts**

   * Internal scaffolding to encourage step-by-step reasoning.
   * Example:

     > "Think step by step before answering. Show your reasoning first, then provide the final answer."

## 🔹 Where Prompts Fit in Agent Configuration

An **agent configuration** might look like this (simplified JSON/YAML style):

```yaml
agent:
  name: "LegalSummarizer"
  runtime: "cloud-k8s"
  llm: "gpt-4"
  mcp:
    temperature: 0.3
    top_p: 0.9
    max_tokens: 1500
  prompts:
    system: |
      You are a legal assistant that summarizes contracts.
      Always write in plain English for non-lawyers.
      Never give binding legal advice.
    user: |
      {{user_input}}
    context: |
      Relevant clauses from contract database:
      {{retrieved_clauses}}
    instructions: |
      Summarize in 3-5 bullet points.
      Highlight risks and obligations separately.
```

## 🔹 Why Prompts Matter

* They act like **configurable guardrails** for the LLM.
* Different agents (support bot vs. code assistant) can reuse the same LLM but behave differently because of **different prompts**.
* Together with MCPs, prompts define the **behavior profile** of an agent.

---

✅ **In short**:
**Prompts in agent configuration are structured instructions (system, user, context, task) that define how the agent interprets inputs, reasons, and responds. They’re the "script" guiding the LLM’s behavior.**

Would you like me to also explain how **prompt templates** (with variables like `{{user_input}}` and `{{retrieved_docs}}`) are used in **multi-agent systems** so each agent can dynamically adapt its instructions?
