## üß† What Is a Knowledge Graph?

A **Knowledge Graph (KG)** is a **structured representation of facts** about entities (people, places, things, events, concepts) and the **relationships** between them ‚Äî organized as a **graph**.

It connects **data + meaning** ‚Üí enabling machines to **reason**, **infer**, and **answer questions** like humans do.

---

### üß© Simple Example

A fact in text:

> ‚ÄúElon Musk founded Tesla.‚Äù

Becomes in a Knowledge Graph:

```
(Entity) Elon Musk  ‚îÄ‚îÄ[FOUNDED]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂  (Entity) Tesla
```

If we add more facts:

```
Elon Musk ‚îÄ‚îÄ[CEO_OF]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Tesla
Tesla ‚îÄ‚îÄ[HEADQUARTERS_IN]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Austin, Texas
```

Now we can answer queries like:

> ‚ÄúWho is the CEO of the company headquartered in Austin?‚Äù
> ‚Üí Tesla ‚Üí Elon Musk.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Structure of a Knowledge Graph

A KG is usually represented as **triples**:

```
‚ü®subject, predicate, object‚ü©
```

| Subject   | Predicate       | Object            |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Elon Musk | founded         | Tesla             |
| Tesla     | manufactures    | Electric Vehicles |
| Tesla     | headquarters_in | Austin            |

Together, these form a **directed labeled graph**.

## üß± Core Components

| Component             | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entities (nodes)**  | Objects or concepts (e.g., Person, Organization, Product)                 |
| **Relations (edges)** | Semantic relationships between entities (e.g., *works_at*, *produced_by*) |
| **Attributes**        | Properties of entities (e.g., age, founded_year)                          |
| **Ontology / Schema** | Defines the *types* of nodes and edges, and their allowed structure       |
| **Inference Engine**  | Derives new knowledge from existing facts (e.g., transitive reasoning)    |

## üß© How Knowledge Graph Works in AI

### 1. **Knowledge Representation**

* Converts unstructured data ‚Üí structured semantic data
  (e.g., from text, database, web pages, etc.)

### 2. **Reasoning**

* Uses logic or graph algorithms to **infer new relationships**.
  Example: If A ‚Üí B and B ‚Üí C, infer A ‚Üí C.

### 3. **Querying**

* Uses graph query languages like **SPARQL**, **Cypher**, or **Gremlin**.

### 4. **Integration with AI Models**

* Graph Embeddings: Represent nodes/edges as vectors for ML models
  (e.g., Graph Neural Networks)
* Improves **recommendations**, **search**, and **question answering**.

## üß† How AI Uses Knowledge Graphs

| Use Case                   | How KG Helps                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Question Answering**     | AI maps query ‚Üí KG relationships to find exact answers                |
| **Semantic Search**        | Matches meaning, not keywords                                         |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Learns from relationships between entities (e.g., users, items)       |
| **Chatbots / Agents**      | Context memory + logical inference                                    |
| **Fraud Detection**        | Detects suspicious patterns in entity relationships                   |
| **Healthcare / Finance**   | Integrates complex relational data (patients, drugs, risks, policies) |

## üßÆ Real-World Examples

| Organization        | Knowledge Graph           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Google**          | *Google Knowledge Graph*  | Powers ‚ÄúKnowledge Panels‚Äù and semantic search                |
| **Facebook / Meta** | *Social Graph*            | Represents relationships between users, posts, likes         |
| **Amazon**          | *Product Knowledge Graph* | Connects products, brands, categories, reviews               |
| **LinkedIn**        | *Economic Graph*          | Models professional connections, skills, companies           |
| **Microsoft**       | *Concept Graph*           | Used in Bing and Microsoft Academic                          |
| **Uber / Lyft**     | *Mobility Graphs*         | Connects drivers, trips, and locations for routing & pricing |

## üîç Example: Query in a Knowledge Graph

**Query:** ‚ÄúWhich companies did Elon Musk found after 2000?‚Äù

In SPARQL:

```sparql
SELECT ?company
WHERE {
  ?company <founded_by> <Elon_Musk> .
  ?company <founded_year> ?year .
  FILTER(?year > 2000)
}
```

## üß† Integration with LLMs (Modern AI)

Modern systems combine **LLMs + Knowledge Graphs**:

| Step                                                                 | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1. **LLM** extracts entities/relations from unstructured text        |             |
| 2. **KG** stores them for structured access                          |             |
| 3. **LLM** queries the KG for verified facts (reduces hallucination) |             |
| 4. **KG** provides grounding & reasoning context to the model        |             |

‚Üí This approach is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG with Knowledge Graphs)**.
