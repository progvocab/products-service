The **`cut` command in Linux** is used to **extract specific sections of text** from each line of a file or standard input.
It works like a "column extractor" â€” very handy for parsing logs, CSVs, or delimited text.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax

```bash
cut OPTION... [FILE...]
```

You must specify **what to cut** (`-b`, `-c`, or `-f`).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Options

| Option | Meaning                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-b`   | Extract by **byte position**                           |
| `-c`   | Extract by **character position**                      |
| `-f`   | Extract by **field (column)** (default delimiter: TAB) |
| `-d`   | Set custom **delimiter** (default is TAB)              |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Examples

### 1. Cut by character position

```bash
echo "abcdef" | cut -c 1-3
```

âœ… Output:

```
abc
```

(Extracts characters 1 to 3)

---

### 2. Cut by field (columns) with delimiter

Suppose you have a CSV file `data.csv`:

```
id,name,age,city
1,John,25,NewYork
2,Alice,30,Boston
```

Extract the **2nd field** (name):

```bash
cut -d',' -f2 data.csv
```

âœ… Output:

```
name
John
Alice
```

---

### 3. Multiple fields

```bash
cut -d',' -f1,3 data.csv
```

âœ… Output:

```
id,age
1,25
2,30
```

---

### 4. Cut by byte

```bash
echo "hello world" | cut -b 1-5
```

âœ… Output:

```
hello
```

---

### 5. Combine with `cat` / `grep`

Get usernames from `/etc/passwd` (fields separated by `:`):

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d':' -f1
```

âœ… Output:

```
root
daemon
bin
...
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ When to use `cut`

* Extract specific columns from logs or CSVs
* Quickly parse `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, etc.
* Fast and memory-efficient for simple tasks (lighter than `awk`)

---

ðŸ‘‰ Quick tip:

* Use **`cut`** for **simple column extraction**
* Use **`awk`** when you need **more complex processing** (math, conditions, formatting)

Do you want me to also show you a **comparison of `cut` vs `awk`** with the same example so you know when to pick which?
