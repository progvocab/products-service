 Letâ€™s draw a **diagram of Java Memory Management** and label all the memory areas managed by the JVM.

          +-----------------------------------+
          |          JVM Memory Model         |
          +-----------------------------------+
                       |
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  |                  Runtime Data Areas                   |
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                       |
  | 1. Method Area (MetaSpace in Java 8+)                 |
  |    - Class definitions, metadata, static variables    |
  |                                                       |
  | 2. Heap (Shared, GC-managed)                          |
  |    - Young Generation                                 |
  |        * Eden Space                                   |
  |        * Survivor Space (S0, S1)                      |
  |    - Old Generation (Tenured)                         |
  |    - Stores objects & arrays                          |
  |                                                       |
  | 3. Stack (per thread)                                 |
  |    - Stack Frames                                     |
  |        * Local Variables                              |
  |        * Operand Stack                                |
  |        * Frame Data                                   |
  |    - One stack per thread                             |
  |                                                       |
  | 4. PC Register (per thread)                           |
  |    - Stores address of current JVM instruction        |
  |                                                       |
  | 5. Native Method Stack (per thread)                   |
  |    - Supports JNI (C/C++ native code)                 |
  |                                                       |

# ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Each Memory Type

### 1. **Method Area (MetaSpace in Java 8+)**

* Stores class metadata, method info, runtime constant pool, and static variables.
* Shared across all threads.

### 2. **Heap**

* Main area managed by **Garbage Collector (GC)**.
* Divided into:

  * **Young Generation**

    * Eden Space: New objects are created here.
    * Survivor Spaces (S0, S1): Objects that survive GC move here.
  * **Old Generation (Tenured)**

    * Long-lived objects move here after surviving multiple GCs.
* Also includes **String Pool** (interned strings).

### 3. **JVM Stack**

* Each thread has its own stack.
* Contains **stack frames**:

  * Local variables (ints, refs, doubles, etc.)
  * Operand stack (intermediate calculations)
  * Frame data (method return addresses, exception handling).

### 4. **PC Register**

* Per-thread register.
* Holds the current instruction address of the threadâ€™s executing bytecode.

### 5. **Native Method Stack**

* Supports execution of native (non-Java) methods.
* Used when calling code through JNI (Java Native Interface).

ðŸ“Œ **Summary**:

* **Heap & Method Area** â†’ Shared by all threads.
* **Stack, PC Register, Native Method Stack** â†’ Created per-thread.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also **draw this as a real block diagram (image with labeled memory sections)** so itâ€™s more visual than ASCII text?
