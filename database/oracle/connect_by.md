Alright — let’s break down **`CONNECT BY`** and **`PRIOR`** in Oracle, using your **Employee** and **Employee Hierarchy** example.

We’ll cover:

1. **Tables & sample data**
2. **How `CONNECT BY` works**
3. **Role of `PRIOR`**
4. **Examples: top-down & bottom-up**
5. **Extras: filtering & ordering**

---

## 1. Tables & Sample Data

Let’s say we have these two tables:

**`EMPLOYEE`**

| EMP\_ID | EMP\_NAME |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 3       | Carol     |
| 4       | David     |
| 5       | Eve       |

**`EMPLOYEE_HIERARCHY`**
(This table links an employee to their manager)

| EMP\_ID | MANAGER\_ID |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 2       | 1           |
| 3       | 1           |
| 4       | 2           |
| 5       | 2           |

Meaning:

* Alice (1) manages Bob (2) and Carol (3)
* Bob (2) manages David (4) and Eve (5)

---

## 2. How `CONNECT BY` Works

Oracle’s **hierarchical query** syntax:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM table
START WITH <root-condition>
CONNECT BY [NOCYCLE] PRIOR <child-col> = <parent-col>;
```

* **`START WITH`** – defines the root rows (top of hierarchy).
* **`CONNECT BY`** – defines **parent-child relationship** for recursion.
* **`PRIOR`** – tells Oracle which side of the relationship belongs to the **previous row** in the hierarchy traversal.

---

## 3. Role of `PRIOR`

The **`PRIOR`** keyword means “column from the previous (parent) row”.

For example:

* **Top-down**: `CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = manager_id`

  * Parent’s `emp_id` matches child’s `manager_id`.
* **Bottom-up**: `CONNECT BY PRIOR manager_id = emp_id`

  * Child’s `manager_id` matches parent’s `emp_id`.

So **changing where `PRIOR` is placed** changes the traversal direction.

---

## 4. Examples

### **A. Top-down** — Find all subordinates of Alice

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, e.emp_id, e.emp_name, eh.manager_id
FROM employee e
JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.emp_id = eh.emp_id
START WITH eh.manager_id IS NULL OR eh.manager_id = 1
CONNECT BY PRIOR e.emp_id = eh.manager_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* `START WITH ... = 1` → Alice is the root.
* `PRIOR e.emp_id = eh.manager_id` →
  Take current row’s `manager_id` and match to parent row’s `emp_id`.

**Output:**

| LEVEL | EMP\_ID | EMP\_NAME | MANAGER\_ID |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1     | 1       | Alice     | NULL        |
| 2     | 2       | Bob       | 1           |
| 2     | 3       | Carol     | 1           |
| 3     | 4       | David     | 2           |
| 3     | 5       | Eve       | 2           |

---

### **B. Bottom-up** — Find all managers of David

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, e.emp_id, e.emp_name
FROM employee e
JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.emp_id = eh.emp_id
START WITH e.emp_name = 'David'
CONNECT BY PRIOR eh.manager_id = e.emp_id;
```

**Explanation:**

* `START WITH David` → start at child.
* `PRIOR eh.manager_id = e.emp_id` →
  Now we go upward (child’s `manager_id` matches parent’s `emp_id`).

**Output:**

| LEVEL | EMP\_ID | EMP\_NAME |
| ----- | ------- | --------- |
| 1     | 4       | David     |
| 2     | 2       | Bob       |
| 3     | 1       | Alice     |

---

## 5. Extras

* **`LEVEL`**: built-in pseudocolumn indicating depth in hierarchy (root = 1).
* **`SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(col, sep)`**: shows full path from root to current row.
* **`NOCYCLE`**: prevents infinite loops if circular references exist.
* **`ORDER SIBLINGS BY`**: keeps hierarchy order when sorting.

Example with path:

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, emp_name,
       SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(emp_name, ' -> ') AS hierarchy_path
FROM employee e
JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.emp_id = eh.emp_id
START WITH eh.manager_id IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR e.emp_id = eh.manager_id;
```

**Path example:**

```
Alice -> Bob -> David
Alice -> Bob -> Eve
Alice -> Carol
```

If you want, I can also draw a **hierarchy diagram** showing how Oracle navigates using `CONNECT BY` and `PRIOR` for top-down vs bottom-up traversal — it makes the direction switch crystal clear.


Got it — we’ll extend the **Employee** and **Employee Hierarchy** example to include a **Sales** table, then show how to retrieve **sales for a given employee and their direct reportees** using `CONNECT BY` in Oracle.

---

## 1. Sample Tables

**`EMPLOYEE`**

| EMP\_ID | EMP\_NAME |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 3       | Carol     |
| 4       | David     |
| 5       | Eve       |

**`EMPLOYEE_HIERARCHY`**

| EMP\_ID | MANAGER\_ID |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 2       | 1           |
| 3       | 1           |
| 4       | 2           |
| 5       | 2           |

**`SALES`**

| SALE\_ID | EMP\_ID | SALE\_AMOUNT |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 101      | 1       | 5000         |
| 102      | 2       | 3000         |
| 103      | 3       | 2000         |
| 104      | 4       | 1000         |
| 105      | 5       | 1500         |

---

## 2. Requirement

* **Input:** Employee name (e.g., `'Bob'`)
* **Output:** Sales of that employee **and** all their **direct reportees** (only one level down, not full hierarchy).

---

## 3. Query – Direct Reportees Only

In Oracle, to get only **direct children**, you can:

* Start from the given employee as root.
* Use `CONNECT BY` with `LEVEL <= 2` to restrict to **root and one level below**.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id,
       e.emp_name,
       s.sale_amount
FROM employee e
JOIN sales s
    ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
START WITH e.emp_name = 'Bob'
CONNECT BY PRIOR e.emp_id = e.emp_id  -- we'll fix this join below
```

Wait, the join in `CONNECT BY` must reflect **manager-employee** relation. Here’s the fixed, full working query:

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id,
       e.emp_name,
       s.sale_amount
FROM employee e
JOIN sales s
    ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
JOIN employee_hierarchy eh
    ON e.emp_id = eh.emp_id
START WITH e.emp_name = 'Bob'
CONNECT BY PRIOR e.emp_id = eh.manager_id
   AND LEVEL <= 2;
```

---

## 4. How This Works

* `START WITH e.emp_name = 'Bob'` → Bob is root.
* `CONNECT BY PRIOR e.emp_id = eh.manager_id` →
  Parent’s emp\_id matches child’s manager\_id.
* `LEVEL <= 2` → only root (level 1) and direct children (level 2).

---

## 5. Output Example for `'Bob'`

| EMP\_ID | EMP\_NAME | SALE\_AMOUNT |
| ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 2       | Bob       | 3000         |
| 4       | David     | 1000         |
| 5       | Eve       | 1500         |

---

If you instead wanted **Bob + all subordinates recursively**, you would just **remove** the `LEVEL <= 2` condition.

If you want, I can also give you **one query without `employee_hierarchy` join** by embedding the hierarchy inside the `CONNECT BY` directly — useful if you want it compact. Would you like me to show that?
