Got it üëç ‚Äî you want an explanation of **routing protocols in Linux**, including things like **EIGRP, OSPF, BGP** and how they fit in. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

---

# üîπ Routing Protocols in Linux

Linux itself **does not implement routing protocols directly in the kernel**.
Instead:

* The Linux **kernel routing table** stores routes and makes forwarding decisions.
* User-space **routing daemons** (e.g., via packages like **Quagga**, **FRRouting (FRR)**, **BIRD**, **XORP**) implement routing protocols (like OSPF, BGP, RIP, etc.).
* These daemons update the kernel routing table via **Netlink** API.

---

## 1. **Static Routing**

* Not a protocol, but a manual setup of routes (`ip route add ...`).
* Useful for small/simple networks.
* **Command Example:**

  ```bash
  ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
  ```

---

## 2. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

* Distance-vector protocol (uses hop count).
* Suitable for **small networks**.
* Linux support via **quagga / frr / bird**.
* Periodically exchanges the full routing table ‚Üí not efficient for large networks.

---

## 3. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**

* **Link-state protocol** (uses Dijkstra‚Äôs SPF algorithm).
* Faster and more scalable than RIP.
* Used inside organizations (**IGP ‚Äì Interior Gateway Protocol**).
* Linux supports via **FRRouting (frr)**, **Quagga**, **BIRD**.
* Builds a **link-state database (LSDB)** and computes shortest paths.

---

## 4. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**

* **Path-vector protocol**, the backbone of the internet.
* Used between organizations (**EGP ‚Äì Exterior Gateway Protocol**).
* BGP in Linux is supported via **FRRouting, Quagga, BIRD**.
* Determines routes using **AS-paths** (autonomous systems).
* Policies (filters, prefix limits, communities) are critical in real deployments.

---

## 5. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**

* Originally **Cisco proprietary**, partially documented later as an IETF draft (not widely used outside Cisco).
* Distance-vector + some link-state features (uses DUAL algorithm).
* Limited support in Linux (not standard in FRR or BIRD).
* Typically you would run OSPF or IS-IS instead of EIGRP on Linux.

---

## 6. **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**

* Another **link-state IGP** (like OSPF).
* Used heavily by ISPs for backbone routing.
* Linux support: **FRRouting**, **Quagga**.

---

## 7. **Other Protocols / Tools**

* **PIM / IGMP** ‚Äì for multicast routing.
* **MPLS + LDP/RSVP** ‚Äì supported in Linux with patches and FRRouting.
* **Policy routing** ‚Äì via `ip rule` and multiple routing tables.

---

# üì¶ Linux Routing Daemons

To run these protocols, install one of:

* **FRRouting (FRR)** ‚Üí Actively maintained, supports BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, PIM.
* **BIRD** ‚Üí Very popular for BGP (used in ISPs, IXPs).
* **Quagga** ‚Üí Older, predecessor of FRR.
* **XORP** ‚Üí Academic/research use.

# ‚ö° Summary Table

| Protocol     | Type                  | Use Case                      | Linux Support         |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Static**   | Manual                | Small/simple networks         | Native (`ip route`)   |
| **RIP**      | Distance-vector       | Small LANs                    | FRR, Quagga           |
| **OSPF**     | Link-state (Dijkstra) | Enterprise IGP                | FRR, Quagga, BIRD     |
| **IS-IS**    | Link-state            | ISP core                      | FRR                   |
| **BGP**      | Path-vector           | Internet routing, ISP peering | FRR, BIRD             |
| **EIGRP**    | Hybrid (Cisco)        | Cisco networks                | Limited, not standard |
| **PIM/IGMP** | Multicast             | Video, streaming              | FRR, pimd             |

‚úÖ So in Linux:

* For **inside a network (IGP)** ‚Üí OSPF, IS-IS.
* For **between networks (EGP)** ‚Üí BGP.
* EIGRP is **rare** outside Cisco.
* Static + policy routing often complements dynamic protocols.

üëâ Do you want me to also show you **a real example of configuring OSPF or BGP in Linux (with FRRouting)**, step by step?
