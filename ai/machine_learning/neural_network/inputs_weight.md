Perfect ðŸ‘Œ Letâ€™s build a **small concrete example** so you see how **inputs and weights** interact in a neural network.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Example: Predicting if a Student Passes an Exam

We have **3 input features (parameters)** for a student:

1. **Hours studied**
2. **Attendance %**
3. **Previous test score**

And we want to predict whether the student will **pass (1) or fail (0)**.

---

## Step 1. Inputs (x)

Suppose for a student:

* $x_1 = 5$ hours studied
* $x_2 = 80\%$ attendance â†’ $0.8$
* $x_3 = 70\%$ previous test score â†’ $0.7$

So input vector is:

$$
X = [5, 0.8, 0.7]
$$

---

## Step 2. Weights (w)

The model learns importance of each feature. Suppose:

* $w_1 = 0.6$ â†’ studying hours are very important
* $w_2 = 0.2$ â†’ attendance has smaller effect
* $w_3 = 0.1$ â†’ previous score has least effect

So weight vector is:

$$
W = [0.6, 0.2, 0.1]
$$

---

## Step 3. Bias (b)

A small constant shift, say:

$$
b = -2
$$

---

## Step 4. Weighted Sum (z)

$$
z = (w_1 \cdot x_1) + (w_2 \cdot x_2) + (w_3 \cdot x_3) + b
$$

Substitute values:

$$
z = (0.6 \cdot 5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) + (0.1 \cdot 0.7) - 2
$$

$$
z = 3.0 + 0.16 + 0.07 - 2 = 1.23
$$

---

## Step 5. Activation Function

Letâ€™s use **sigmoid** (common for binary classification):

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

$$
\sigma(1.23) \approx 0.773
$$

---

## Step 6. Final Output

The neural network outputs **0.773** â†’ meaning \~77% chance the student will pass.
If threshold = 0.5 â†’ prediction = **PASS** âœ….

| Input Feature              | Value | Weight | Contribution |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Hours studied ($x_1$)      | 5     | 0.6    | 3.0          |
| Attendance ($x_2$)         | 0.8   | 0.2    | 0.16         |
| Previous score ($x_3$)     | 0.7   | 0.1    | 0.07         |
| **Bias (b)**               | -     | -      | -2           |
| **Weighted sum (z)**       | -     | -      | 1.23         |
| **Final Output (sigmoid)** | -     | -      | 0.773 â†’ PASS |

âš¡ This is exactly how each neuron in a neural network works â€” combine inputs Ã— weights + bias â†’ pass through activation.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **scale this up to multiple neurons in a hidden layer** so you see how weights work when there are more than one output path?

---
### Hidden Layer

 Letâ€™s **extend the example** to include a **hidden layer with multiple neurons**, so you see how inputs and weights work when there are more than one path.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Example: Neural Network with Hidden Layer

Weâ€™ll use the same **student exam prediction** setup.

* **Inputs (features):**
  $X = [x_1, x_2, x_3] = [5, 0.8, 0.7]$

* **Architecture:**

  * Input layer â†’ **3 inputs**
  * Hidden layer â†’ **2 neurons** (h1, h2)
  * Output layer â†’ **1 neuron** (predict pass/fail)

---

## Step 1. Weights & Biases

* **Hidden layer neuron h1**

  * Weights: $W_{h1} = [0.5, 0.2, 0.4]$
  * Bias: $b_{h1} = -1$

* **Hidden layer neuron h2**

  * Weights: $W_{h2} = [0.9, 0.3, 0.5]$
  * Bias: $b_{h2} = -2$

* **Output neuron**

  * Weights: $W_{out} = [0.7, 0.6]$ (for h1 and h2)
  * Bias: $b_{out} = -1$

---

## Step 2. Hidden Layer Computation

For each hidden neuron:

$$
z_{h1} = (0.5 \cdot 5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.8) + (0.4 \cdot 0.7) - 1
$$

$$
z_{h1} = 2.5 + 0.16 + 0.28 - 1 = 1.94
$$

Apply sigmoid:

$$
h1 = \sigma(1.94) \approx 0.874
$$

---

$$
z_{h2} = (0.9 \cdot 5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.8) + (0.5 \cdot 0.7) - 2
$$

$$
z_{h2} = 4.5 + 0.24 + 0.35 - 2 = 3.09
$$

$$
h2 = \sigma(3.09) \approx 0.956
$$

---

## Step 3. Output Layer Computation

Now use hidden outputs as inputs to output neuron:

$$
z_{out} = (0.7 \cdot h1) + (0.6 \cdot h2) - 1
$$

$$
z_{out} = (0.7 \cdot 0.874) + (0.6 \cdot 0.956) - 1
$$

$$
z_{out} = 0.6118 + 0.5736 - 1 = 0.1854
$$

Apply sigmoid:

$$
y = \sigma(0.1854) \approx 0.546
$$

---

## Step 4. Final Result

* **Prediction probability = 0.546 (\~54.6%)**
* Threshold = 0.5 â†’ **PASS** âœ…

âœ¨ Here you see how:

1. Inputs flow through **multiple neurons**,
2. Each neuron has its **own set of weights**,
3. Hidden outputs are used as **inputs to the next layer**,
4. The final activation gives the **probability of prediction**.

---

Would you like me to **draw a diagram of this neural network with all weights labeled**, so itâ€™s visually clear how data flows through?
