# **Kubernetes Deployment Strategies**  

When deploying applications in **Kubernetes**, choosing the right strategy ensures **zero downtime, rollback capabilities, and efficient resource utilization**. Below are the most commonly used deployment strategies.

---

## **1️⃣ Rolling Update (Default)**
🔹 **Gradually replaces old pods with new ones**  
🔹 **No downtime**  
🔹 Can be controlled using **maxSurge** and **maxUnavailable**  

### **📌 How It Works**
- New pods are gradually created while old ones are terminated.
- Ensures **zero downtime** by maintaining a minimum number of running instances.
- Suitable for **most applications** that can handle incremental updates.

### **📌 Example Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rolling-update-demo
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1        # Extra pod allowed during update
      maxUnavailable: 1  # Max pods that can be unavailable
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo-container
        image: my-app:v2  # New version of the app
```
✅ **Best For:** Most applications, ensuring smooth updates without downtime.  
❌ **Drawback:** If something goes wrong, rolling back can take time.

## **2️⃣ Blue-Green Deployment**
🔹 **Two identical environments (Blue & Green)**  
🔹 **Instant rollback if issues occur**  
🔹 **Uses a Service to switch traffic between versions**  

### **📌 How It Works**
1. **Blue** represents the live version.
2. **Green** is deployed with the new version.
3. Traffic is switched from **Blue** to **Green** using a **Kubernetes Service**.
4. If something goes wrong, traffic can be reverted to **Blue**.

### **📌 Example Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app-green  # Switch to new version dynamically
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
✅ **Best For:** Critical applications requiring zero downtime and easy rollback.  
❌ **Drawback:** Requires **double resources**, which can be costly.



### **Canary Deployment**
- **Deploys new version to a small subset of users**  
- **Progressively increases rollout if stable**  
- Uses **labels and selectors** to manage traffic  


1. Deploy **new version** to a small percentage of users.
2. Monitor for failures (e.g., using Prometheus).
3. Gradually shift more traffic to the new version.
4. If issues arise, roll back easily.


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: canary-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app:v2  # Canary version
```
**Best For:** Applications requiring gradual exposure to minimize risks.  
**Drawback:** Needs **traffic management (e.g., Istio, Nginx Ingress)** for routing.



### **Recreate Deployment**
 **Stops old version before deploying the new one**  
 **Downtime occurs during deployment**  
 **Simple and resource-efficient**  


1. All existing **pods are terminated**.
2. New pods with the updated version are created.
3. There is a **brief downtime** between stopping old pods and starting new ones.

### **📌 Example Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: recreate-deployment
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate  # Stops old pods before creating new ones
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo-container
        image: my-app:v2
```
 **Best For:** Stateless applications where downtime is acceptable.  
 **Drawback:** Causes **downtime**, making it unsuitable for high-availability services.



### **A/B Testing Deployment**
 - **Routes traffic based on user attributes (e.g., location, device, user group)**  
- **Requires advanced traffic management (e.g., Istio, Nginx Ingress)**  
- **Can test different features for different users**  

### **📌 How It Works**
1. Users are split into different groups (e.g., **Group A gets v1, Group B gets v2**).
2. Routing happens **at the load balancer level**.
3. Telemetry data is analyzed to decide the success of the new version.

✅ **Best For:** AI-based features, feature flag testing, and gradual rollouts.  
❌ **Drawback:** Needs **advanced traffic control tools**.

## **Comparison Table**

| Strategy          | **Downtime** | **Rollback** | **Resource Usage** | **Use Case** |
|------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Rolling Update   | No         | Slow rollback | Efficient | Most applications |
| Blue-Green      | No         | Instant | High (duplicate resources) | Critical applications |
| Canary          | No         | Fast | Moderate | Gradual rollouts with monitoring |
| Recreate        | Yes        | Fast | Low | Simple apps where downtime is okay |
| A/B Testing     | No         | Fast | High (requires traffic splitting) | Feature flag testing |

### **Which Deployment Strategy Should You Use?**
- **For zero-downtime, safe updates → Rolling Update**
- **For instant rollback & critical apps → Blue-Green**
- **For gradual testing & exposure → Canary**
- **For simple, non-critical apps → Recreate**
- **For user-based experiments → A/B Testing**



A Kubernetes Deployment manages application updates using different rollout strategies such as Rolling, Recreate (all-at-once), Blue-Green, and Canary. In the Recreate strategy, Kubernetes terminates all existing Pods before starting new ones. Rolling updates replace Pods gradually—new Pods come up first, receive traffic once healthy, and then old Pods are taken down. In Blue-Green deployments, an entire new set of Pods (green) is created alongside the existing set (blue), and traffic is switched to green only after verification. Canary releases create a small subset of new Pods and route only a small percentage of traffic to them initially; if they perform well, Kubernetes increments traffic until all requests move to the new version.
